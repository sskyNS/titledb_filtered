Master these new maneuvers and you might cut down your time to the finish line! \n\nTake on a classic Grand Prix, or go the distance in the Knockout Tour elimination mode\n\nSpeed through one course and then drive to the next in a non-stop rally that stretches from one corner of the world to another in the adrenaline-packed Knockout Tour!

With Grand Prix and VS Races also supporting up to 24 drivers, the competition has never been tighter!\n\nRace online* across modes with up to 23 other players, or talk with friends using GameChat as you race or roam. Through CameraPlay, you can even see your friends\u2019 faces next to their vehicles as you zoom past them, whether you\u2019re online or on the same couch. Hop into a match of Balloon Battle or Coin Runners for even more mayhem, or get focused and strive for your personal best in Time Trials.
