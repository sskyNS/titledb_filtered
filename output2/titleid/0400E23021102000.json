	"intro": "Hunt giant beasts using a variety of Karakuri tech, now with up to 3 teammates!",
	"description": "\u2022 Fight back against giant nature-infused beasts.\nAs a hunter, you will face off against beasts that have endured the blazing lava, raging blizzards, and rising miasma plaguing the harsh lands of Azuma. These beasts, known as Kemono, embody the very essence of nature in all its beauty and ferocity. The key to surviving the fight lies in joining forces with comrades and wielding Karakuri technology.\n\n\u2022 Develop your hunting grounds using Karakuri technology.\nWeaving the threads of Karakuri enables you to instantly create basic items like crates and gliders. You can even combine these items to develop Karakuri like beast-piercing blades, protective shields, and traps to stop movement in real time, all of which can aid you in your battle against the Kemono. There are also some Karakuri that will remain on the field, giving you the freedom to place them in strategic locations and create your own ideal hunting grounds.\n\n\u2022 Customize your play experience with diverse combat styles.\nThe game features a wide range of equipment. From general weapons like the nodachi and bow, to unconventional ones like the karakuri katana and bladed wagasa, each weapon has unique characteristics. By utilizing materials gathered from the hunts to craft new equipment, hunters can persist in their pursuit of beasts. This ongoing cycle enables hunters to grow even stronger and challenge themselves in combat against numerous fearsome Kemono.\n\n\u2022 The story and world:\nNo one remembers why the Kemono began their rampage through a once-prosperous Azuma. Fueled by desperation, they wield the power of primal nature at its most destructive. For a while, it seemed that none could stand against their overwhelming might. But hope arrives in the form of a formidable hunter armed with deadly weapons and ancient technology called Karakuri that could turn the tide of battle.",
