	"description": "\"RIDGE RACER\" is a racing game released by NAMCO (Bandai Namco Entertainment) in 1993.\nExperience the essence of virtual reality using the 3D CG system \"System 22.\"\nThis game has four modes to choose from, including three difficulty levels - NOVICE, INTERMEDIATE, and ADVANCED - as well as T.T. (TIME TRIAL), where you compete one-on-one against a rival car to achieve the best time. Additionally, a DX version featuring support for an H-shifter and clutch is also included.\n\n\u3000The \u201cArcade Archives\u201d series began in May 2014 with the concept of faithfully reproducing classic arcade games. With the release of \u201cRIDGE RACER,\u201d the series introduces \u201cArcade Archives 2\u201d series, featuring a completely redesigned user interface.\n\u3000In addition to the \u201cORIGINAL MODE,\u201d \u201cHIGH SCORE MODE,\u201d and \u201cCARAVAN MODE\u201d included in the \u201cArcade Archives\u201d series, \u201cArcade Archives 2\u201d series will add new features such as \u201cTIME ATTACK MODE\u201d and \u201cNETWORK MODE.\u201dIn \u201cTIME ATTACK MODE\u201d you compete to see who can beat the final boss the fastest stating from the first battle. This mode focuses on how quickly you can complete the game, regardless of the score you achieve. In \u201cNETWORK MODE\u201d you can play against other users over the network. However, \u201cTIME ATTACK MODE\u201d and \u201cNETWORK MODE\u201d may not be implemented in some games. Since \u201cRIDGE RACER\u201d is a single-player game, \u201cNETWORK MODE\u201d is not implemented.\n\u3000Additionally, functionality has been significantly enhanced. Multiple save slots have been implemented instead of just one, along with a rewind feature that allows players to retry gameplay and a quick start feature for those who want to dive straight into the game. Furthermore, VRR support has been added, enabling more accurate reproduction of the original arcade game's experience.\n\u3000Enjoy the legendary arcade masterpiece with \u201cArcade Archives 2,\u201d now more fun and user-friendly.\n\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
