	"description": "Released by SEIN SOFT in 1986, this side-view Action Role-Playing Game (Action RPG). Players control the hero Tritorn, battling numerous monsters and embarking on an adventure to restore peace to Luwanda Island, which is dominated by Pay Balusa.\n\nTritorn fights primarily using jumps and his sword. While the core strategy involves predicting enemy movements and quickly closing in, an advanced technique exists: sword strikes during a jump deal double damage! As Tritorn grows, he can learn magic that instantly erases or freezes enemies. Use these actively when surrounded.\n\nThough it is an Action RPG, simple enemy defeat is not the only path to progression. The game includes puzzle-solving elements, such as obtaining specific items by defeating enemies consecutively. These well-incorporated elements prevent monotony, allowing for a deeply engaging experience.\n\nWith fast-paced, skill-based action, well-integrated puzzle elements, three types of magic to learn as you level up, and battles against giant bosses, this masterpiece is highly encouraged for all gamers, not just Action RPG fans.\n\n *This application does not have a scene select mode.\n *The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n *Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
