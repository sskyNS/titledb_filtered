As the Diver, it\u2019s up to you to descend into the depths, restore power, and reconnect your community to the long-forgotten station below.\n\nNavigate aging structures, repair failing platforms, and uncover what led to the sudden collapse of the world above. The deeper you go, the more the station\u2019s past\u2014and its purpose\u2014begins to surface.\n\nExplore and repair the station before your home falls into ruin.\n\nFEATURES & MECHANICS\n\nLogic-based Circuitry Puzzles\n\nEvery puzzle is a circuit waiting to be solved. Switch connections, complete pathways, and restore power by interacting with different components in clever ways. The deeper you go, the trickier the puzzles become.\n\nClassic Platforming Goodness\n\nRun, jump, and navigate the submerged ruins with fluid, satisfying movement, balancing precision platforming with puzzle-solving.\n\nDiverse Aquatic Atmospheres\n\nFrom faded steel corridors to glowing depths alive with energy, 6 biomes guide your descent. The station\u2019s architecture grows more intricate, its colors more vibrant, and the surrounding marine life more varied as you restore power and uncover its secrets.\n\nA Descent into Mystery\n\nYour mission begins where the power failed. Fellow Tidekeepers instruct and guide you, their voices familiar in the depths. The station\u2019s story begins with a blackout and ends with a choice only you can make.\n\nImmersive Soundscape & Original Tunes\n\nThe station comes alive with creaks, groans, and echoes of the deep, accompanied by an atmospheric, handcrafted soundtrack designed to pull you further into the abyss.",
