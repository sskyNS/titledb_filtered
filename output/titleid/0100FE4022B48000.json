	"description": "Here is the robot that will be delivered to you.\n\nThis robot is the only one that can enter the mysterious land called \"The Land of Mirrors.\" However, right now, a time bomb has been set in this strange land, and it is about to be destroyed. Please use this robot to disarm the time bomb within the time limit. To save the fantastic Land of Mirrors... (From the user manual)\n\nThis game is a puzzle game released in 1987 in Japan. The player teaches a robot, equipped with artificial intelligence, to remember action patterns and disarm bombs. The game has two main objectives: the first is the primary goal of finding the time bomb and transporting it to the bomb disposal unit within the time limit; the second is to train and educate the robot, giving it learning abilities, making it smarter, and handling the puzzles effectively. This training and development of the robot is one of the main attractions of the game.\n\nThe maze stages contain areas lit by \"lamps\" and \"batteries,\" creating illuminated spaces, and areas that are in darkness. In the illuminated spaces, the robot can be freely controlled, but in the dark spaces, some of the robot's controls are restricted, and you will need to rely on the robot's autonomy to progress.\n\nSince the robot moves using light as energy, its energy depletes in the dark spaces. If its energy reaches zero, the game is over. Effectively teaching the robot to act accurately in the dark spaces will be the key to successfully completing the game.\n\nThis game combines simulation elements of robot training with puzzle elements for disarming time bombs. It is recommended for those who want to enjoy both genres.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
