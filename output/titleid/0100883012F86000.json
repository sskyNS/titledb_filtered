	"description": "Princess Farmer is a match3 puzzle and visual novel game with easy to learn action mechanics and different difficulty levels that let you breeze through the game or challenge you to earn more rewards. The story is played in episodes, much like magical-girl anime, with each lasting between 20 minutes to 1 hour, depending on your chosen difficulty level, your skills, and whether you decide to skip dialogue interactions. Different level goals keep you on your toes and bring a fresh approach to the match3 genre. Dialogue options let you choose how Princess Farmer interacts with her friends, affecting your relationships with them. Make them your BFF and they may reward you with gifts!\n\nPrincess Farmer was just an ordinary farmer when one day she woke up under the Gaia Tree. Now through the magic of Mother Gaia, she can hoist up whole rows of veggies with ease to make matches and smash obstacles by herself, in co-op, or even with an AI companion! Something mysterious is happening in the woods and it's your job to puzzle your way to uncover it! You'll learn about the world around you as you talk and build relationships with the loveable characters including: Mother Gaia, Garlic, Shoppe Keeper Rowan, and even Bot Bunny!",
