	"description": "\u25cb This game is a remake version of the past \"First Queen\".\n\"Prologue\" where \"Konstantin\" acts as the main character has been recorded.\nIn the main story, you can choose between 1st and 2nd unit battles.\nIn the two-unit battle, the strategic element becomes stronger, and a unit of magicians can fight alone with other allied units.\nEnemy units will also become stronger, and enemy magicians will also use summons.\n\nYou can switch units to counter the enemy units that rush in one after another, and a powerful battle unfolds.\nEquipped with a mercenary system. With points, various characters such as beast masters, poets, and enemy officers will become allies.\nWe've also added a number of items exclusive to specific characters.\"\nThe points used are obtained in the game. If you try again, the points remain. Also, if you clear the fierce battle in this work, you can get a big point.\n\n\u25cb Each character moves according to their own will. Each character fights or runs away.\nWhen normal \"soldiers\" lose their health in battle, they flee from the enemy and rest until they recover, but \"knights\" fight without running away.\nAlso, the knight tries to fight fair and square, so he doesn't surround the enemy.\nCompatibility\" depends on the opponent you fight. It's hard to tell because it doesn't show up in numbers, but shamans and clergymen can fight in a variety of ways, such as being strong against undead.\n\n\u25cb The original game is over 30 years old\nThis game has a unique system called \"Gocha Chara\" in which many characters automatically fight.\nWhen First Queen first appeared in 1988, it was a hit with many people fighting in chaos, but its presence faded in the era of MMOs.\nHowever, the job of the user who leads the low-level AI characters is how to help the characters who are reckless, and this is still a game like no other.\nIn the past, we have also developed games that have been extended to 3D, but we dared to recreate the original taste with a \"simple AI that moves in four directions\" as it was in the past.\n\n",
