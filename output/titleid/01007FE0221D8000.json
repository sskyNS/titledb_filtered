	"description": "\"Hello, Mario!\" Are you ready to play? With this free application from the little-kid-friendly My Mario brand, you and your kiddo can play with Mario's face and delight in all his various expressions.\n \n\u25a0Make Silly Faces\nTeam up with your kiddo to see how silly Mario can get when you pull and stretch his face or take turns poking and spinning him around. Tap on the ? Block in the top-left corner of the screen and select an icon to make items\u2014like a Super Mushroom, a Super Star, or pipes\u2014and even enemies appear alongside Mario.\n \n\u25a0Peekaboo!\nInvite Mario to play peekaboo by tapping on the leftmost icon in the ? Block menu. Boo may even make a guest appearance! \n\n\u25a0Built-In Breaks\nGood night, Mario! Mario gets tuckered out after playing for a while and will fall fast asleep. At that point no amount of poking can wake him up! This is a great opportunity to take a break and help parents limit their child's screen time. If you want to keep the fun going, you can turn off this feature by tapping the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen when the application starts.\n \n\u25a0Play Offline\nThere's no need to be connected to the internet to play this application. After you download it, you're good to go!\n\nOperation is not guaranteed for all devices that meet the operating conditions. It may not work properly depending on the device's performance and specifications, device-specific application usage conditions, etc.\n\nPlease be sure to read the Health and Safety information provided in the application settings before you start playing. Settings can be accessed by tapping the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen when the application starts to access the menu.\n\nTerms of Service:\nhttps://support.nintendo.com/en/legal-notes/my-mario-eula-selector",
