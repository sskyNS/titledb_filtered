	"description": "Rediscover Game Night with the magic of Sunderfolk, a shared turn-based tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller*.  Built with a couch co-op experience in mind, up to four players adventure through the magical and dangerous Sunderlands.\n*The free mobile app is required to play the game.\n\nEach player picks one of six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue). Together, players venture out into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat.  During combat, there is no set player turn order, so your strategy can adapt at a moment's notice to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to co-operatively find the best path to success. \n\nBetween missions, players return to Arden and help improve their home village. Unlock and upgrade different local vendors, build relationships with other Sunderfolk to earn rewards, and outfit characters with new Skills, Weapons, Trinkets, and more.\n\nAs heroes of Arden, protect the town and its Brightshard from the corruption of shadowstone and defeat threats from the surrounding Sunderlands. \n\nCouch Co-Op First\nThe best adventures are meant to be shared. Up to four players can play together in this new tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. \n\nStep into a New World \nScan a QR code on the display, download the free Sunderfolk phone app*, and transform your phone or tablet into a controller, hand of cards, rule book, inventory, and more. All friends and family can learn to play quickly, since all they need will be in-hand. \n\nSix Unique Heroes \nTraditional RPG classes have been reimagined in Sunderfolk. Take up the mantle of an Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger or Rogue \u2013 each with their own playstyle. Tailor your character\u2019s strengths with Skill Cards. Power up with Trinkets and Weapons to craft your character\u2019s build  quest-to-quest. \n\nTactical Combat Inspired by the Tabletop\nEach player takes their turn one at a time by choosing one of their Skill Cards to determine their character's actions. Enemies lurk around every corner, each with their own abilities and strategies, and they will challenge your party to change its approach from one encounter to the next.\n\nRebuild the Village of Arden \nThe village of Arden grew around the remnant of a magical substance known as brightstone, but unknown forces from lands outside have started to threaten this community's very existence. Between quests, return to Arden village to upgrade vendors, acquire new items and equipment, and befriend townsfolk for additional rewards. \n\nFour Players, One Game\nShare the experience of Sunderfolk with friends at no extra cost. Our rather unique mobile device as a controller mechanic lets one gamer share the adventure with three friends at no additional cost. A host can even stream a session and have friends join remotely.",
