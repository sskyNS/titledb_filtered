	"description": "This game, released in 1986 in Japan, is an adventure game and a sequel to the previous year's \"Azteca.\" Players embark on an adventure set in the ancient ruins of Chichen Itza in Mexico, searching for the Temple of the Sun and the Sun Key. The game is divided into two parts: a field part with RPG-like controls for movement, and an adventure part where the screen switches at specific locations. In the adventure part, various actions can be performed by selecting different icons.\n\nOne of the main features of this game is its high difficulty level. While many adventure games can be solved by trying all possible commands, this game makes that approach impossible. Furthermore, it's possible to find yourself stuck without realizing it, and the game does not necessarily end with a game over when you're stuck. This creates a challenging and engaging experience. If you find that the game isn't progressing, rather than persisting in frustration, it may be necessary to start over and try a different approach.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
