	"description": "A vessel floating down a river contains an orphaned baby boy. He is found and adopted. As he grows, he learns of his true identity and destiny of greatness. Thus is the premise of two of the greatest stories of our time, but that is where the similarities end. Now we\u2019re not saying that \u201cShaq Fu: A Legend Reborn\u201d is better than the Good Book; that would be blasphemy. But please consider the following questions:\n\n\u2022 Does the Bible feature BASKETBALL LEGEND SHAQUILLE O\u2019NEAL AS AN ASS-KICKING WU XING MASTER? \n\u2022 Can the Holy Writ boast A DOPE RAP FEATURING THE BIG ARISTOTLE HIMSELF?\n\u2022 Does the Book of Books provide the EXCITEMENT AND HILARITY OF BATTLING BOSSES WHO ARE PARODIES OF FAMOUS DOUCHEBAGS?\n\u2022 Do any of the conflicts depicted in The Sacred Testimony qualify as EPIC BOSS BATTLES THAT YOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY PUT INTO A GAME?\n\n\u201cShaq Fu: A Legend Reborn\u201d DOES contain all of those thrilling features and many more!  So buy it. It\u2019s pretty cheap.\n",
