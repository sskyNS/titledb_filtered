	"description": "Get your brain ready and sharpen your curiosity in Do You Really Know?, a charming quiz game where every correct answer is a step toward the top of the Owls\u2019 Tower of Knowledge. It starts easy, but don\u2019t be fooled. The higher you climb, the tougher the questions become.\n\nWith each streak of correct answers, you advance through the tower\u2019s floors and earn points to exchange for helpful power-ups. They give you that extra push when challenges get tricky and can make all the difference at critical moments. Made a mistake? No problem. You return to the preparation area, take a breath, and try again, now a little wiser.\n\nWith cute visuals, a relaxed atmosphere, and questions that test general knowledge without pressure, Do You Really Know? is perfect for players who enjoy smart quizzes, quick sessions, and the satisfying feeling of learning while playing.",
