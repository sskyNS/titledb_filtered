	"description": "Universal Century, Seven-Two-O\n\nHuman life on Earth had been wiped out, forcing humanity to migrate to space. The fate of the next migration was entrusted to the REINBOW Nebula. However, the REINBOW Nebula consisted of six planets with completely different environments, all ruled by a single governing planet\u2014and they viewed humanity as an absolute enemy. As time flowed, a mysterious soldier raced through the unknown. When he laid eyes on an armored suit with five radiant lights, his destiny was forever changed.\n\nInto the Future (From the Player's Manual)\n\nThis is an action RPG originally released in 1986 in Japan. Players take on the role of the aforementioned mysterious soldier and embark on an adventure across six planets.\n\nThe game features a side-view action RPG format, where each planet consists of two stages: an aerial stage with a shooting-based playstyle and an underground stage where hand-to-hand combat and action mechanics come into play. Key locations, such as underground entrances and the end of each stage, feature formidable boss battles. By uncovering their weaknesses, players can experience thrilling and tense encounters.\n\nThe game's difficulty is notably high. In aerial combat, running out of fuel causes health to gradually deplete, and when it reaches zero, it's game over. Thus, managing fuel stations as central bases for resupply is essential. On stages where refueling isn't possible, players must carefully select a low-power thruster to conserve fuel. Proper fuel management is a critical technique for survival. Additionally, some stages lack shops altogether, making it crucial to stock up on necessary items beforehand.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
