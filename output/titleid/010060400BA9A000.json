	"description": "1-4 Players can battle against time-honored characters in a nostalgia-inducing collage of retro set-pieces from BurgerTime, Karate Champ, Lock \u2018N Chase, Heavy Barrel, Side Pocket, and Bad Dudes!  \n\nPlay as Peter Pepper, the burger-boppin\u2019 hero of Burger Time! He\u2019s not your classic little chef anymore. Wield shotguns, laser rifles, pistols, and machine guns as you lay waste to your opponents in a desperate tug-of-war to THE BANK!  \n\nSnag the prized MONEY BAG as you release hoards of prisoners while leaping over bottomless pits in the Heavy Burger arena.  \n\nBattle the grenade-tossing Green Men from Heavy Barrel as they blast through reinforced steel onto the cliffside fortress. Dodge over hundreds of rounds as tanks and turrets pepper the battlefield.  \n\nShoot explosive pool balls at your friends in a level inspired by Side Pocket. Sink \u2018em all for an extra dose of chaos!  \n\nCrush your enemies under the enormous weight of falling burger pieces while blasting Pickles, Eggs, and Hot Dogs in the BurgerTime arena.  \n\nNavigate a procedurally-generated and fully destructible maze while running from cops, dodging explosive cars, and collecting major coin in the Lock \u2018N Chase level.  \n\nDodge mad charging bulls, high flying kicks, and a discerning judge\u2019s eye in the Karate Champ arena. Watch the crowd roar as you pummel your opponents.  \n\nSkirt through heavy traffic, roundhouse kicks, and flaming ninjas as you speed boost to your final destination, THE BANK, in the Bad Dudes arena.  \n\nDeposit that coin with the help of President bank manager Ronnie himself. Take a free ride in his chopper and bask in the glory of HEAVY BURGER MADNESS on the White House lawn.  \n\nGood Luck. We\u2019re all counting on you.",
