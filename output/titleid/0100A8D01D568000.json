	"description": "When Chico the chubby-cheeked chipmunk stumbles into a portal in the forest, he\u2019s transported to a magical world! Here he finds giant walnuts galore, but getting them home won\u2019t be easy! Solve puzzles and challenges across a variety of unique levels, gather a horde of giant walnuts, and help Chico get back to his forest!\n\nWith unique dual-mode gameplay, you\u2019ll have to really use your nut to crack these worlds. Alone, Chico can jump over obstacles and push wall switches. If he has a walnut, he can roll it over spikes, bounce it off of walls and bumpers, and more. Find a way to get the walnut through to the end of the level with you! Each world introduces unique new mechanics that will test your brain and your skills.\n\nChico and the Magic Orchards is made to evoke 8-bit handheld games. Catchy chiptune music, simple controls, and pixel-grid filters let you feel like you're playing a \"lost classic\"! Play the game in fixed 4-color mode, automatic palette mode with a special 4-color palette for each area, or the new Full Color mode!\n\nEven after the end credits roll, that's not the end of Chico's adventure! Continue your game after beating it to start playing the new post-game campaign A Hive Divided! Rescue trapped bees across two new giant levels, and defeat the Queen Bee. Power up your walnut with fire, water, and honey for a whole new spin on solving puzzles and exploring areas!",
