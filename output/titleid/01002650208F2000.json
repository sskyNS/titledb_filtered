	"intro": "Locked in a tower from a young age, Christina sought the Architect of Creation",
	"description": "In Tyre, 200 A.D., the young Christina was locked in a tower by her father. Gazing out at the magnificent world outside, she sought the True Creator of the Universe, and He revealed Himself to her. This is her story.\n\nIn this Synaxarion installment, explore Tyre to complete quests, find lost items, and watch the story of Christina the Great Martyr unfold.\n\nThese stories are short and are not intended to take up much time to play through. Expect to play for 40-60 minutes to complete this experience.\n\nThe Synaxarion is a collection of Saints\u2019 lives, which are celebrated each day of the year. They are a light that leads us to Christ in every generation, a living Gospel. The ministry and very life of Christ is worked out in the lives of the Saints, His faithful servants. They are the glory of the Church, the God-bearers on earth and in heaven. Most of the saints were unknown to the world, but the Grace of God made them known to the whole universe and to all the ages. Amen.",
