	"description": "TUNGROOMS: Escape Sahur is a terrifying survival horror game where you find yourself trapped in an eerie backrooms environment. Unlike any ordinary maze, this nightmare is haunted by Tung Tung Tung Sahur, a terrifying creature that once lived within these walls but now seeks to escape its own twisted existence. As you journey through this horrifying labyrinth, you\u2019ll uncover notes and eerie drawings scattered throughout the levels\u2014hints left by the creature itself.\n\nYour only hope for survival is to locate and collect five hidden images in each level. These images contain clues that might be the key to escaping this nightmare. But be warned: the deeper you venture into the backrooms, the more sinister the surroundings become. Realistic walking mechanics create an immersive, tense atmosphere, where every step is filled with dread. The ever-present terror of Tung Tung Tung Sahur will leave you on edge as you race to solve the mystery and escape.\n\nPrepare yourself for terrifying jump scares, psychological horrors, and an atmosphere that will chill you to the core. Can you escape the madness before it consumes you?",
