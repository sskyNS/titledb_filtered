	"description": "Operation: Hostage Rescue throws you deep behind enemy lines, where the jungle hides more than just trees. Armed to the teeth and dropped into hostile territory, you\u2019ll navigate deadly ambushes, sweeping gunfights, and tightly guarded compounds in a top-down tactical shooter that never lets up.\n\nEach mission is a blend of chaos and precision \u2014 dodge mines, outsmart enemy patrols, and face down heavily armored bosses, including tanks and elite units. The environment may look green and calm, but every corner hides danger, every bullet could be your last, and every rescued hostage is a step closer to surviving the war zone.",
