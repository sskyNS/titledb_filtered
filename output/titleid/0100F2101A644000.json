	"description": "Kind-hearted girl was trapped by the evil shogun. He wants to forcefully marry her, but that\u2019s not gonna happen \u2014 our brave geisha will surely find the way to escape her prison cell and past all the deadly traps and labyrinths of the mighty evil-doer. Luckily she has a tiny sidekick by her side \u2014 a talkative mouse who will guide her through these deadly halls.\n\nSuper Geisha Neon combines the platforming experience with arcade puzzles just like they did in the 80\u2019s. Trust us, it\u2019s old school all the way. Players will need to time their jumps, coordinate their actions and use their wits to solve some interactive puzzles. These goodies are packed with comfy pixel art that is basically infused with 8-bit nostalgia. Do you remember the times of epic retro games and chiptune music? You\u2019ll find them in our newest title as well!",
