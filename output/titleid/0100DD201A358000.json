	"description": "\"DIG DUG II\" is an action game released by NAMCO (Bandai Namco Entertainment) in 1985. In this game, you must rid an island of the familiar POOKA and FYGAR. In addition to defeating monsters by inflating them, you can now jackhammer fault lines around the island that can weaken the ground enough for it to collapse, taking enemies down into the water below. Defeat all monsters to advance to the next stage.\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.\n\n*This game uses the Japanese ROM for the main part of the game.\nThe options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
