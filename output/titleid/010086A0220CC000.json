	"description": "After the catastrophe, the world became devastated, monsters roamed freely, crops could no longer grow. People had to rely on hunters to obtain the necessary water and food. It is said that all the disasters originated from a demon king. The legendary lucky hunter set out to hunt the demon king but never returned...\n\nUnder the old village chief's guidance, a young hunter, carrying chess pieces with magical power, set off on a hunting journey along the path once taken by the legendary hunter, bearing the hopes of the entire village. Become the lucky hunter who grows stronger with each battle, builds a unique deck, embarks on strange hunting journeys, and conquers powerful prey from forests, swamps, and volcanic regions to save this world on the brink of crisis!\n\nAs a lucky hunter who grows stronger with each battle, building a powerful deck, embarking on a unique journey of hunting, and conquering mighty prey from forest, swamp, desert, volcano and snow mountain.\n\n\n-Continuously make progress through procedurally generated hunting maps, carefully choosing routes to explore different nodes such as battles, shops, enchantments, events, and more.\n-Your pieces are automatically played onto the battlefield, and players will focus on matching and building unique decks and relics, fully exploiting the synergies between pieces.\n-When three same-level pieces are adjacent on the battlefield, they will automatically combine into a higher-level piece, forging an unbreakable force.\n-Gain new pieces every turn in battles, building your own powerful deck from over 100 pieces and 100 relics.\n-As battles last, the attack from the prey will become increasingly fierce. Eliminate opponents in time and strive to become stronger before death comes.\n-Regardless of success or failure, each adventure yields experience and lessons. Improve base attributes through external growth, and purchase unique piece packs that introduce new mechanics.",
