	"description": "Become a God once again in Reus 2 by taking control of mighty giants whose command over their elements allows you to shape worlds, create an ecosystem of resources and enable human civilizations to thrive. Your choices will determine the fates of these fragile human beings, whose autonomy may lead them to great heights.\n\nShape worlds with Giants\nUtilize a roster of 6 powerful Giants, each with their own unique abilities over plants, animals and minerals that will allow you to create new biomes for humans to settle their villages. As you progress, gain inspiration to unlock more skills for your Giants, providing you with a diversity of choices.\n\nRelationships and disasters\nWith the !New Cataclysm update!, you can choose to take on more optional challenges. Leaders can now form relationships with Giants and each other based on their personality, become allies through trade or go to war. Humanity can also turn against your giants, sending out Giant Hunters to destroy them! Punish them with disastrous new powers, using the elements to teach them to respect the gods.\n\nCreate thriving ecosystems\nTerraform a variety of biomes, strategically build up different combinations of flora, fauna and materials specific to those environments. By experimenting, discover which combinations create the best synergies for the inhabitants' needs and goals, leading you into exciting new eras of their existence.\n\nLead humanity into the future\nShape the development of humanity with your choices as they evolve from early human societies to modern civilizations. Whether it's travelling to the stars as space explorers, starting a cult or wishing to cultivate nature, they will all have their goals. No matter the outcome, remember, you can always start a new humanity.\n\nFill a galaxy with life\nEach playthrough leaves a lasting legacy in the stars by generating a new planet for you to experiment with. Fill the galaxy with endless variations of life and be inspired to take a new path with your next creation.",
