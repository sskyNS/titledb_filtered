	"description": "This title is an adventure game released in Japan by Riverhill soft in 1987 and serves as the third entry in the detective J.B. Harold series, following \"MURDER CLUB\" (1986) and \"Manhattan Requiem\" (1987). However, as indicated by the phrase \u201canother story of MANHATTAN REQUIEM\u201d on the title screen, it is not a numbered sequel but rather a parallel story to the second game, \"Manhattan Requiem.\"\n\nThe story centers on the theft of \"The Blue Lament\" sapphire from a jewelry store, driven by complex human relationships and intricate deductions. This title introduces the \"Deduction\" command, a first for the J.B. Harold series. Unlike previous games, proper use of this deduction is now required for progression, offering a more advanced mystery adventure.\n\nLooking back at its historical context, the game also featured an interesting experiment for its time. \"KISS OF MURDER\" required players to load image data from \"Manhattan Requiem\" in order to play. As a result, owning a copy of \"Manhattan Requiem\" was necessary. It is said that the developers assumed, \"Since this is a side story, only fans who own the previous game would buy it. So let\u2019s make it low-priced by loading data from the prior title!\"\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
