Motivated to finally be able to show the fruits of his training, he carries out his first orders to perfection only to find out that The Core was far from being the noble organization he thought he knew.\n\nA Nuanced Look at War: Experience the clash of modern conflict against civilian life through the contrast of intense RPG combat and slower, slice-of-life gameplay.\n\nCommunication is Key: As Long Gone Days is set in the real world, you'll encounter several language barriers. Recruit interpreters in order to communicate with others and forge bonds beyond borders.\n\nStrength in Others: Meet a colorful cast of potential comrades. Grow relationships through your words and actions as you live and fight together.\n\nKeep Morale High: Choose dialogue options wisely to boost morale in battle. Every character has distinct personality traits and motivations.\n\nStrategic RPG Combat: Spot and take down targets from afar in Sniper Mode, or engage up-close in front-view, turn-based combat.
