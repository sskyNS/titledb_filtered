	"description": "In Football Drama, you are Rocco Galliano, the Marseillaise new manager of Calchester Assembled Football Club.\nAfter the abrupt ending of your coaching career seven years ago, the hysterical attention of the press quickly faded. But struggling results by Calchester FC convinced Boris Aluminovitch, its billionaire president, to axe the previous beleaguered manager and give you a new chance.\nWill your raucous shouts from the bench change the fate of the team? Will you find wiseness and karma leadership with the help of the Book of Changes? Will your shady past reach back to you and make you crumble?\n\nChances that you can make it through a full season are slim. Corruption, crime, drugs and romance are all paths that you may take - for better or worse. This is the only football game where you may lose the championship and win the game!\n\nKey features:\n- Interactive narrative with meaningful game-changing choices.\n- Karma or chaos: life choices, game choices.\n- Turn-based match play with live-action animations.\n- 18 dramatic weeks of procedural championship where you can be fired at any time.\n- Deck-building mechanics determined by life choices and game results.\n- Ridiculous cards about the craziest aspects of today's football\nIllustrated log of each of your matches.\n- Silly main commentator with his obligatory colourful sidekick.\n- Replayable - every championship is unique, several different endings.",
