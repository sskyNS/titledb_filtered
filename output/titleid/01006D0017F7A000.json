	"description": "The brothers return for a brand-new adventure on the high seas! A mysterious power has fractured the world of Concordia into many scattered islands, and it\u2019s up to Mario and Luigi to reconnect them. Venture out on Shipshape Island (part ship, part island) and launch out of its cannon to visit, explore, and quest your way through islands that range from tropical rainforests to bustling cities. Meet new friends along the way, like Connie and Snoutlet (definitely not a pig), and encounter familiar faces from the Mushroom Kingdom like Peach and Bowser, who may help\u2014or hinder\u2014you on your journey.\n\nMake choices about the order you visit islands in, and your approach to the challenges you\u2019ll face, as you chart your path through the story!\n\nRely on Mario and Luigi\u2019s brotherly bond and abilities to succeed \n\nUnleash the mighty power of Mario and Luigi\u2019s brotherly bond to overcome adversity and thwart foes! Use Bros. Moves to bypass obstacles while you explore by turning into a ball or UFO, or even throwing fire and ice balls to melt or freeze something in your way. Take advantage of powerful Bros. Attacks like Zapperator in a dynamic twist on turn-based combat, where well-timed attacks, dodges, and counterattacks are key to defeating foes! \n\nEquip Battle Plugs for extra abilities, like guaranteed critical hits against flying targets, to get a strategic advantage on your enemies. Swap Battle Plugs whenever you want, and experiment with creative combinations to create different effects\u2014you\u2019ll need every edge this \u201cbrothership\u201d gives you to save the day!\n\nDiscover the power of Luigi\u2019s inventive mind with Luigi Logic\n\nLuigi\u2019s got lots of ideas for handling problems. His flashes of inspiration will help Mario explore, solve puzzles, collect items, and more. He\u2019s also got some, er, unconventional approaches that might take you by surprise. Wait until you see the tricks he comes up with to help you deal big damage in boss battles!",
