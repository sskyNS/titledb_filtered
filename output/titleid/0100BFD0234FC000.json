	"description": "-Darkness Stirs Once More-\nDark Quest returns with its fourth installment - a turn-based strategy adventure inspired by the legendary HeroQuest board game. Enter a realm of perilous dungeons, cunning traps, and powerful magic as you lead your party of heroes against the forces of the Dark Sorcerer.\n\nGulak, the sorcerer\u2019s puppet, commands monstrous legions that stalk the night. Villagers vanish without a trace - stolen in silence, never to be seen again. Only your band of champions can stand against this tide of darkness and end Gulak\u2019s reign of terror.\n\n\n-Build Your Party of Heroes-\nCommand up to 10 unique heroes, each with distinctive stats and powers. Train them in the Hero Camp, unlock new cards and abilities, and forge your perfect dungeon-delving team.\n\n-Strategic Dungeon Adventures-\nEmbark on 30 handcrafted quests filled with tactical, turn-based combat and deadly surprises. Outsmart over 40 unique monsters, evade lethal traps, and wield both magic and steel to survive sprawling, multi-floored dungeons that test your wit and courage.\n\n-Local Coop-\nTeam up with friends locally in couch co-op, combining your heroes\u2019 strengths to overcome Gulak\u2019s legions together. Coordination is key - one false move could doom you all.\n\n-Customize Your Experience-\nPlay your way with custom difficulty settings, and countless strategic combinations that make every run feel unique and rewarding.",
