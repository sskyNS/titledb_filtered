	"description": "Take a sip of coffee and wake up your inner poet. Let the words flow with the soft waves of Lo-Fi music. Chill, ease your mind and create.\n\nHaiku is a form of poetry, originated in Japan. The basic rules are very simple. It consists of 3 lines. Very, very short and compact! 5 Syllables in the first line, 7 in the second line and finally 5 in the last, third line. And it doesn\u2019t even have to rhyme. Quite nice, right? And how relaxing it\u2019s to create one! Especially with calming notes of Lo-Fi Music, magical animations and steam rising from a cup of coffee.\n\nLo-Fi Haiku: Coffee and Chill is a tool which will help you on your journey of becoming the greatest Haiku Master. Use the words we provide, play around with them, change them, form them into sentences and in no time you will have your own poem. Traditionally Haikus describe nature and its wonders, but YOU can make it about anything! You can write about your cat or grandma. Anything goes as long as you have fun!\n\nLo-Fi Haiku: Coffee and Chill features:\nSolid selection of words, you can use to create poems\nTools to help you count syllables \nPlenty of good vibes coming from chill and nice Lo-Fi music\nStunning, magical animations\nAll the good vibes :) ",
