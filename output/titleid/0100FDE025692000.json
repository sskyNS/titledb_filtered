	"description": "Sharpen your axes and get ready to slide into adventure! In Slide Viking, every move matters as you glide across the grid, smash crates, and collect the treasure chests hidden throughout the kingdom. What starts as a simple journey quickly becomes a true test of logic and planning. You play as a bold viking whose mission is clear: gather every chest of gold the land has to offer. With continuous sliding movement, you\u2019ll need to think several steps ahead, undo mistakes infinitely, and break obstacles that stand in your way. The puzzles grow trickier with each level, mixing clever layouts and satisfying \u201caha!\u201d moments. The game features 30 handcrafted puzzles across two unique settings. Begin in the Village, a humble place of wood and earth where your skills are forged. Then, prove your worth inside the Castle, the richest and most fortified place in the realm, with stone walls and floors that raise the challenge. Whether you\u2019re after a casual puzzle to relax with or a series of smart challenges to conquer, Slide Viking delivers a journey full of brains, treasure, and plenty of sliding fun.",
