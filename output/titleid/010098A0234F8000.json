	"description": "Cinnabunny is a cute rabbit-filled game focused on running a bakery and living in a village with fellow buns. Cinnabunny is meant to be a relaxing, cozy experience designed for gamers and non-gamers alike. It can be played locally by one or two players.\n\n\nStory\n\nOh no! Your cute, hoppy bun family is fighting a nasty drought. They'll be okay for a while, but your mother has tasked you with finding a new place for the family to live. After a long journey, you've found it! Welcome to Sugar Creek Burrows, a paradise among buns. Run your new bakery and save up so your family can move here too!\n\n\nBake It 'Til You Make It\n\nLearn various recipes, like breads, pies, and cookies. Make them your own by adding special combinations of supplemental ingredients like berries, nuts, or spices!\n\n\nForage / Farm for Ingredients\n\nDifferent recipes require different ingredients. And a true baker will find or make those ingredients themselves! Plant wheat and make flour, forage for easter eggs in the forest, or even head to the caves to mine for salt!\n\n\nCharm Your Community\n\nSugar Creek Burrows is a quaint village bustling with fun and quirky buns. Unlock new dialogue as you progress the relationship and gift them your baked goods to discover their individual taste preferences.\n\n\nDecorate Your Bakery\n\nYour bakery doubles as your living quarters. Make your house a home by organizing your baking tools, adding furniture, and maximizing coziness.\n\n\nBirdwatch\n\nUse your birdoculars to capture pictures of the various bird species around Sugar Creek Burrows. With over thirty species of birds to discover (each with true-to-life bird calls), you'll have to scour the skies in various weather, seasons, and times of day to find them all.\n\n\nCapture Recyclobots\n\nRowan, a scientist bun, added some robotic components to her garbage in an attempt to solve the world's littering problem. Alas, the experiment went horribly awry! Use your net gun to capture all the rogue recyclobots.\n\n\nCollect Mushrooms\n\nThe village of Sugar Creek Burrows and its surrounding forest and caves are home to 40 different species of mushrooms. Become an expert mycologist!\n\n\nAdvance Your Skills\n\nYour bun has four basic skills in Cinnabunny: baking, foraging, birdwatching, and recycling. Every time you perform the skill successfully, you'll get better at it, giving unique bonuses as you level up.\n\n-----------------\n\nThis game encourages co-operative gameplay. Players share an inventory and have access to the same tools. Also, while player 2 can do everything player 1 can, you cannot enter different unique sections of the map at the same time (so if one player wants to go to the forest or the caves for example, both players must go). Buns stick together, after all!",
