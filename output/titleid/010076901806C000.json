	"description": "The Great Lighthouse that once protected the Archipelago is broken and a storm of malice and corruption is coming.\n\nTogether, you and your ship mates will jump aboard The Stormstrider and make your voyage across the sea. Man the cannons, ready your sails and protect your ship from sea monsters over multiple runs. It\u2019s up to you to defend your home from the almighty Aquapocalypse.\n\nIn a nutshell, Ship of Fools is a game about blasting away your seaborne foes with mighty cannons as you defend your ship.

As they sing in old sailor songs: it\u2019s sometimes better to have no crew than a dysfunctional one!\n\nWith many Fools to play with, unique items to find and unlock, combat encounters to fight in and many islands to visit, each run will bring something new to your voyage.
