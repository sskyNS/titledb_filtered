	"description": "Command a fearless band of dwarves in a roguelike auto-battler filled with chaos, strategy, and loot. Every run challenges your tactics as you recruit, equip, and position your squad against waves of enemies that grow stronger with every battle. Glory, death, and loot await those who dare to lead.\n\nBuild your legion of dwarves\nRecruit and customize up to ten unique dwarves, each with their own class, stats, and abilities. Create powerful synergies by mixing tanks, assassins, healers, and mages. Every item and formation choice can decide victory or defeat.\n\nStrategize before the battle begins\nYour dwarves fight automatically, but the outcome depends on your preparation. Arrange your formation, manage your resources, and pick upgrades that complement your team\u2019s strengths. The right setup is the difference between triumph and a total wipeout.\n\nGather gear and legendary loot\nCollect weapons, armor, and accessories after every encounter. Upgrade your heroes, craft new builds, and experiment with combinations to discover deadly strategies.\n\nMaster the roguelike loop\nEach run is a fresh challenge. Choose your rewards, face unpredictable enemies, and push deeper for greater treasures. Even failure brings progress as you unlock new dwarves, skills, and permanent upgrades.\n\nFace growing threats\nBattle orcs, trolls, dragons, and countless monsters across varied stages. Adapt to enemy types and evolve your strategy with each run.\n\nEasy to play, hard to master\nWith one-tap controls and endless strategic depth, Dwarves: Glory & Loot is a game for players who love tactical thinking, build experimentation, and the thrill of progression.\n\nLead your dwarves to glory, embrace the chaos, and claim your loot.",
