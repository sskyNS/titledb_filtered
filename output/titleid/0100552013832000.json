	"description": "Sam is an ordinary kid who, with the help of his red cape, turns into \"superhero\" Pajama Sam. In No Need to Hide When It\u2019s Dark Outside, Pajama Sam journeys into the land of darkness (his closet) to face his fears. Help Pajama Sam figure out who or what is behind the darkness and realize that there is no need to hide when it\u2019s dark outside!\n\n\u2022 Think, listen, explore - fun learning encourages critical thinking, fosters listening and memory skills, and reinforces good social skills.\n\u2022 Like the real world, Pajama Sam's world changes every time you play.\n\u2022 Everything comes to life: appliances sing, furniture dances, trees talk.\n\u2022 Out of time? You can save the game and finish it later.",
