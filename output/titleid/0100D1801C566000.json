	"description": "Shield King is an action and survival game set in a world enveloped by a strange gray mist. After coming into contact with this mist, people have transformed into violent monstrosities. The mist seems to be closer to the ground, prompting people to seek refuge in high places, although safety is not guaranteed. Little is known about this mysterious phenomenon.\n\nIn the game, rescue helicopters have been deployed, and your mission is to find the highest possible location and survive until rescue arrives. Unfortunately, the only weapon you have is a trash can lid. Prepare to face intense challenges as you battle the monsters and search for scarce resources to stay alive.\n\nWith immersive graphics and a dark atmosphere, Shield King offers an exciting and suspenseful experience. Explore the mist-affected world, make strategic decisions, and demonstrate your survival skills in a dangerous environment. Good luck on this journey for survival!",
