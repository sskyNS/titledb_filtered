	"description": "The characters are brought to life using E-mote animation system.\nWhen they breathe, wink, or speak, it all looks very realistic.\nAdditionally, the game features Japanese voice acting.\n\nTime flows like a river, quietly taking away the warmth of the past, yet unable to erase the whispers deeply buried in the heart.  \nMemories are like the morning mist, soft and hazy, drifting across the distant years.  \nUnspoken longing, like starlight on the far side of time, never extinguished, patiently awaits the moment to be rediscovered.  \n\nAn enchanting journey through the silence of time, allowing you to experience the echoes of emotions at the end of time, and feel the eternal bond in the boundless years.",
