	"description": "Welcome to a world where power, destiny, and strategy collide.\n\nIn \"The Arcana: Dark Tarot & Kings of Madness\", the legendary Tarot cards are no longer symbols.\nThey are dangerous, charismatic men, each embodying a different Arcana, driven by ambition, dominance, and hidden intent.\n\nTalk to them.\nGo on dates to unlock new abilities.\nEarn their loyalty\u2026 or challenge their authority.\n\nBut connection is only the beginning.\n\nWhen conflict begins, conversations give way to strategic, roguelite-inspired card battles, where every run challenges you to adapt, plan, and assert control.\n\nBuild your deck using the Arcana you\u2019ve bonded with and face enemy armies in encounters where every card shapes the outcome.\n\nYour choices shape more than relationships.\nThey define how your Arcana fight, how they evolve, and which powers they are willing to place in your hands.\n\nThis is not a traditional visual novel.\nThis is a fusion of narrative tension and tactical card combat.\n\nSome Arcana seek domination.\nOthers demand loyalty.\nAll of them have a price.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u25cf ARCANA AS CHARACTERS:\nThe Tarot comes to life as powerful male Arcana, each with distinct abilities, personalities, and ambitions.\n\n\u25cf NARRATIVE PROGRESSION & DATES:\nTalk to the Arcana, go on dates, and unlock new skills that directly affect combat.\n\n\u25cf STRATEGIC ROGUELITE CARD COMBAT:\nEvery run is different. Adapt your deck, manage risk, and refine your strategy as challenges escalate.\n\n\u25cf DECK BUILDING & SYNERGY:\nCreate powerful combinations using the Arcana you\u2019ve bonded with and define your own playstyle.\n\n\u25cf ARMY BASED ENCOUNTERS:\nFace increasingly dangerous enemy forces in tactical card battles where positioning and timing matter.\n\n\u25cf CHOICE DRIVEN EVOLUTION:\nYour decisions influence how the Arcana grow, fight, and which powers they are willing to place at your disposal.\n\n\nWill you command the cards\u2026\nor lose yourself to their madness?",
