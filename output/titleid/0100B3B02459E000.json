	"description": "A TIMELESS CLASSIC RETURNS \nR-Type Delta is one of the finest shoot \u2018em ups ever and took the gaming world by storm upon its release in 1998. Now, 27 years later, history repeats itself with R-Type Delta: HD Boosted. With its tight level design, three selectable ships, powerful Delta Weapons, and the brilliant Force mechanic, this new edition proves that gaming classics of this caliber are truly timeless. If you played R-Type Delta back in the day, this is the perfect opportunity to return to its dark science fiction action. If you've never experienced this essential piece of gaming history before, now is the time. \n \nSHARPER THAN EVER  \nR-Type Delta: HD Boosted features high-resolution graphics that hone the polygonal edges of this PlayStation masterpiece until they\u2019re sharp enough to cut glass. You simply haven\u2019t experienced R-Type Delta until you've played it in high definition. This version of the game also comes equipped with a new Practice Mode for those of you who want to polish your skills until they are as sharp as the resolution itself! \n \nNEW MUSIC BY H\u00dcLSBECK, ISHIDA AND THE USP SOUND TEAM \nThe atmospheric music has always been a highlight of R-Type Delta. The HD Boosted version also includes brand-new, optional tracks composed by Masahiko Ishida (R-Type II, Image Fight), the USP sound team (who wrote the music for the original 1998 version), and \u2013 last but by no means least \u2013 Chris H\u00fclsbeck. H\u00fclsbeck is, of course, one of the true icons of video game music, having previously worked on R-Type for the C64 and Amiga. This new R-Type Delta: HD Boosted soundtrack is truly out of this world! \n \nENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING \nWhat has always made R-Type Delta so fantastic is its dark, eerie atmosphere. Shoot-'em-ups are not typically known for storytelling, but R-Type Delta: HD Boosted excels with its simple, minimalist environmental storytelling, characteristic of the late \u201990s. It\u2019s a narrative that is as fascinating as it is unsettling, as adrenaline-pumping as it is deeply disturbing. And all this without a single word being spoken. \n \nTHE MEANING OF DELTA \nThe name \u201cDelta\u201d carries several meanings. Firstly, the Greek letter delta resembles a triangle, which coincidentally has as many sides as there are playable ships in the game. It is also the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, and R-Type Delta is the fourth game in the R-Type series. Additionally, the delta triangle is the simplest type of polygon, which is fitting since R-Type Delta was the first game in the series to use three-dimensional polygon graphics instead of two-dimensional sprites. \n \nSTORY \nThe year is 2163, and the badly damaged R9 Arrowhead fighter has just returned to Earth after its mission to destroy the Bydo Empire. The vessel is rescued by the battle-cruiser Croque-Monsieur and transported to an orbital space station. One year later, astronomers in Central Asia observe mysterious objects falling from the sky, and moments later, control is lost over the orbiting annihilation platform Moritz-G. This high-tech machine, capable of destroying the entire planet, descends over a city and levels it to the ground. Although its planet-destroying weapons have not yet been activated, its advanced defense systems make Moritz-G virtually impossible to approach. A desperate military operation is launched, and the prototype ship R9aII Delta is deployed to resolve the situation. Thus begins the epic battle that is R-Type Delta! ",
