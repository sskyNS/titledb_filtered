	"description": "Meet Nika, a brilliant girl that doesn\u2019t fit the world she lives in. Perhaps it\u2019s the chocolate shake with a shot of cognac she carries in her backpack which makes her different. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that at 7 years old her favourite things are the transfer of energy, magnetic fields and electrical engineering. But anyway... It doesn't matter if her parents don't listen to her. It doesn't matter if her teacher ignores her. It doesn't matter if her classmates are dorks. Nothing matters anymore because she has a plan to solve everything. A really\u2026 odd plan.\n\n- A different adventure where you will join Nika in her quest to complete MechaNika.
