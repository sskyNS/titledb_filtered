	"description": "Enter a puzzle experience that defies conventional design! Immortus Temporus is a game created by a speedrunner for those who love to hone their skills through practice, trial and error, determination and relentless replay. Stages have numerous ways to beat them. Crashing into hazards will deactivate them and teleport the player back to the spawn point, allowing free passage from A to B, but is that the fastest route?\n\nThe actions you take in Immortus Temporus persist through death, whether it\u2019s collecting a pick-up or destroying an obstacle. Levels only reset when you run out of time. Each attempt will challenge you to outperform yourself, to think outside the box and break the game!\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Speedrun your way through dozens of puzzling levels.\n\u2022 Respawn instantly upon death!\n\u2022 Push your skills to the limit with zero RNG sabotage.\n\u2022 Discover tricks and exploits intentionally layered within the design.\n\u2022 Skip any 30 levels and still finish the game!",
