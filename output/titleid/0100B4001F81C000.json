	"description": "The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022\u2019s most acclaimed RPGs!\n\nYou are a sleeper, an emulation of a human mind housed in an artificial body. You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.\n\nChoose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.\n\nSTAY AHEAD OF YOUR PAST\nAfter a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.\n\nREBOOT / REBUILD / REPAIR\nCitizen Sleeper\u2019s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.\n\nPUSH YOUR LUCK\nEach character class now has a unique \u201cPush\u201d ability that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success.\n\nNAVIGATE THE BELT\nChart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Starward Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.\n\nDO THE JOB, GET PAID\nContracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You\u2019ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you\u2019ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR FUTURE\nPlayer choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices. The future of your character is up to you.",
