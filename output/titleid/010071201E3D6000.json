He warns you against going any further, but the intrigue of what lies beyond far surpasses the instinct of self-preservation.  \n \nPlay as a young thief and explore the dangerous ruins of a once-prosperous kingdom. Fight against hordes of terrifying monsters, make your way through challenging platforming sections and discover the secret that lies at the very bottom of the ruins in this handcrafted experience. \n\nChrysolite is a narrative driven, pixel-art, 2D platformer with Soulslike inspirations. \n\n\u25cf Intriguing narrative \n\nThere is more to these ruins that meets the eye. Find the pieces, connect the dots and discover the dark story of the last days of the kingdom. \n\n\u25cf Simple, yet challenging gameplay \n\nJump, attack and use the potions you may find along the way.
