	"description": "The all-out robot action-shooting game \"Strania -The Stella Machina-\", reminiscent of the good old days of arcade games, has evolved into the \u201dEX\u201d (Extra) version and will become available on the Nintendo Switch\u2122! \nBy combining both strategic and exhilarating gameplay along with dramatic presentation and high-quality sound design, we believe players will surely be moved!\n\n\u25a0The \u201cOriginal version\u201d and \"EX version\u201d explained\nThe arcade and home-console versions (also known as the \"Original versions\") of \"Strania -The Stella Machina-\u201d, made by the independent Japanese game developer G.rev Ltd. (G.Rev), was first released in 2011. Nearly a decade later, in 2020, The \u201cEX\" version was released in arcades as \"Strania -The Stella Machina- EX\u201d with quality-of-life changes and additional content. This enhanced \u201cEX\u201d version that was first released for arcades will finally be available for home-consoles for the first time on the Nintendo Switch\u2122!\n\n\u25a0Here comes \"EX\"! Changes from the original version\nBelow are the main changes from the original version. \n\n1: Balance adjustments that make it easier to play \nThe player\u2019s armaments have been buffed across the board.\nTo accommodate this change, enemy attacks and other variables have been adjusted. \nIn addition, the difficulty level of the existing \"NORMAL,\" \"HARD,\" and \"EXPERT\" modes were lowered.\nAs a result, the game has been adjusted to be more forgiving and easier to play than the original version!\n\n2: Difficulty level \"HELL\" added\nThe much harder \"HELL\" mode has been added, it is considerably more difficult than the previous highest difficulty \"EXPERT\". \nConsider it a challenge from G.rev to those who have mastered Strania!\n\n3: Addition of an arranged soundtrack\nThe game can be played with a soundtrack arranged by Keishi Yonao himself, who was in charge of the music in the original version!\n\n4: The true ending is now obtainable on the \"NORMAL\" difficulty level\nIn the original version, you could not get the true ending by playing on the \u201cNORMAL\u201d difficulty. But in \u201cEX\u201d, you can reach the true ending even on the \u201cNORMAL\u201d difficulty.\n\n5: DLC \"SIDE VOWER\" from the original version included\nThe additional story \"SIDE VOWER\", which was originally sold separately as DLC, will now be included for free with the Nintendo Switch\u2122 version! \nExperience \"Strania\" once again from the perspective of Bower's army, the enemy of the Strania army!",
