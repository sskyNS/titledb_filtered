	"description": "Orbital Bullet is a fast paced 360\u00b0 action-platformer with rogue-lite elements, where all actions take place in a circular pattern. Fight your way through a variety of procedural planets and use body modifications, crafting, upgrades and heavy weaponry.\n\nTRIGGERFINGER LICKIN\u2019 GOOD ROGUE-LITE ACTION\n- 360\u00b0 hard-boiled gunplay: Projectiles traverse in a 360\u00b0-degree pattern allowing for a new unrivaled gunplay feeling.\n- \u201cJust one-more-run\u201d: Procedurally generated planets, mean enemies, bad-ass bosses, a diverse weaponry and game changing upgrades guarantee addictive gameplay.\n- Make the most satisfying long-range curved snipes you have ever done or blast and shred enemies with a load of your hyper shotgun. Or are you more of a rocket launcher fella?\n- Fast paced unrelenting pixel style-action: each death is permanent, but let\u2019s be honest, dying is part of the fun. \n\nA DEATH-DEFYING PROGRESSION SYSTEM\n- Having a hard time making progress? Don\u2019t worry, we got you covered! After each death you will be able to spend Nanobytes to receive permanent upgrades and skills.\n- How about a bigger Medi-Backpack or extra Shield to last a little bit longer?\n- Or activate the Combo System, to tremendously increase the pacing of the game and receive certain multipliers to currency drops and EXP.\n- Don\u2019t like your starting weapon? Unlock a new more powerful one right from the start and get your revenge.\n\nUNLIMITED FRAG-TASTIC REPLAYABILITY\n- Build your own custom skill tree with our Dynamic Skill Trees! Make clever decisions to empower skills and reach new power spikes while the tree changes every time you play.\n- \u201cWe need guns, lots of guns.\u201d Unlock, find, or buy more than 42 different guns, weapon upgrades and various power-enhancing perks that will change the way you\u2019ll play.\n- Unlock four different classes to choose from, like the turret-carrying Engineer or the fire-fueled Hellion, each with a different skill tree.\n- Are you the type of person who enjoys some good ol\u2019 pain? Good, because we got a Streak System that will make the game considerably more difficult (coupled with a few other surprises) with each completed run, until your streak ends. Don\u2019t worry though, you will have plenty opportunity to die.\n\nA HEAD-BLASTING SOUNDTRACK\n- Orbital Bullet features a pounding electronica soundtrack composed by Juha Korpelainen & Niilo Takalainen. If you die a lot, at least you can listen to some catchy tunes.",
