Each portal leads to a deadly arena where three intense waves of demonic enemies await.\nUse a deep, action-packed combat system featuring dashes, combo strikes, dodges, ranged magic attacks, and a powerful rage mode. Pay attention to health, stamina, and mana as you fight, and adapt your style by switching between two unique heroes. Each victory earns you a demon soul\u2014and five are required to open the massive magic gates and push deeper into haunting new regions like the Forest of Whispers, the Frozen Wastes, or the Infernal Depths.",
