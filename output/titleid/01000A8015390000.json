You jump into the role of a little bird, explore beautiful landscapes and collect the missing feathers of your little bird friend.\n\nBecause there are no enemies or any danger of any kind you will be able to lean back and enjoy the scenery and the sensation of flying. It is a great game for relaxing and calming down after an exhausting day full of hassle.\n\nEvery level has two parts. A first introduction into the overall theme and a second one that gives a little more time to play around and to enjoy the beauty of the area. Of course, you can always select the level that you feel helps most to relax yourself. Most levels can be finished quite quickly so that you can freely choose spend time exploring the environment but you don\u2019t have to stay for too long if you are just looking for a short moment of peace and enjoyment. \n",
