	"description": "Participation Guide for the Experiment\nThank you for your interest in the hypothesis regarding the symmetry between vision and hand movement.\n\nThis experiment aims to measure the ability to transmit information from vision to the brain and from the brain to the hands using a game, and to verify whether this ability improves through repetition.\n\nIn the game, you control the left hand with your left hand and the right hand with your right hand to reach the goal.\nThe hands can change movement direction, jump, and run.\nAlthough it is a simple game, controlling two separate hands independently may cause significant stress for participants.\nPlease do not force yourself to continue the experiment and take breaks as needed.",
