	"description": "The city after dark is never neutral.\n\nShadows stretch longer than they should, streets feel watched, and certain encounters carry an intensity that can\u2019t be ignored. \n\nAs a vampire on the run, every night pulls you deeper into a world where danger and attraction exist side by side.\n\nIn Vampire Boys Love Story: Date or Die, time moves relentlessly forward. Days pass. Hunters close in. And the boys you meet seem drawn to you: sometimes with curiosity, sometimes with caution, and sometimes with something far more dangerous.\n\nThese encounters aren\u2019t simple.\nInterest builds slowly.\nTrust is never guaranteed.\nAnd desire often comes with unspoken conditions.\n\nThis narrative visual novel blends romance with survival, placing equal weight on conversation, perception, and choice. \n\nBut connection has a cost.\n\nVampire hunters patrol the night, forcing you to escape, fight, or disappear when necessary. \n\nSome relationships offer protection.\nOthers awaken power.\nAnd a few may pull you toward a fate you can\u2019t outrun.\n\nTrust carefully.\nChoose who you let close.\nThe night remembers every mistake.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u25cf ROMANCE & SURVIVAL VISUAL NOVEL: A narrative experience where attraction and danger evolve together.\n\n\u25cf TIME PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Days advance naturally, increasing tension and shaping events.\n\n\u25cf CHOICE BASED DIALOGUE: Your words affect trust, desire, and who stands beside you.\n\n\u25cf VAMPIRE HUNTERS & CONFRONTATIONS: Escape pursuit, face threats, and fight to stay alive.\n\n\u25cf MULTIPLE ROUTES & ENDINGS: Relationships, abilities, and outcomes change with every decision.\n\n\u25cf ANIME VISUAL STYLE: Expressive character art and moody city environments.\n\n\nChoose your connections.\nSurvive the pursuit.\nPlay now!",
