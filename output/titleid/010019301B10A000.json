Everything you need can be found and recycled from trash, and if you befriend local neighbours, they may prove very helpful during your farming and adventuring endeavours.\n\nFARMING\nFind seeds, become a farmer, and use your produce to cook delicious dishes that can be traded for useful items! There are tons of plants, fruits, vegetables, flowers and trees to find and grow.
