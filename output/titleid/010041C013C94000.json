	"description": "Color the World together!\nDiscover a new world, but do not do it alone - take a friend, play together! Travel together through increasingly demanding levels of difficulty in many interesting biomes. Color the world decolourised by the evil Mona Chrome! You will be accompanied by some popular and distinct heroes who can, but certainly do not, remind you of familiar characters. Our heroes are monophobes, so they must act together to get her!\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\u2022 Dynamic!\nThanks to a variety of gameplay mechanics and the special abilities of individual heroes, Together is highly dynamic game. Additionally, in co-op mode, you can expect dynamic and lively split-screen. But be careful, you have only 5 second to connect back!\n\n\u2022 Color the World!\nThe world has been decolourised! You must collect Pictorian crystals to unlock more characters that will help you defeat the sinister Mona Chrome!\n\n\u2022 ToGetHer\nRemember that playing together, you\u2019ve got a better chance of winning and (certainly) much more fun coloring the world!\n",
