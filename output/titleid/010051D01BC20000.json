	"description": "The rules of the game are simple - you need to throw a basketball into the basket and earn points.\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The ball obeys all the laws of physics, so you have to use all your skills and concentration to get right into the basket. With each level, your skills will grow, but so will the complexity of the levels. But we believe in you - you will definitely become a basketball master!\n\nGAME FEATURES:\n\u2022 Excellent warm-up for accuracy;\n\u2022 Many levels of varying difficulty;\n\u2022 Realistic physics of the ball's behavior;\n\u2022 Simple and minimalistic graphics;\n\u2022 Management with the Joy-Con\u2122\ufe0f controllers;",
