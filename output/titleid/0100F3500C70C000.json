	"intro": "Jet Lancer is a high-velocity aerial combat shooter where you duel enemy aviators, hunt giant robots, and defy death at supersonic speeds.",
	"description": "You are Ash Leguinn: badass pilot, highly paid mercenary, and flight-school drop out. Your day job is fine - the daily grind of dealing with Sky Pirates pays the bills - but nothing compares to the rush of demolishing a ninety-ton mechanical monstrosity at the speed of sound. And you\u2019ll have your chance. As mechanized weapons converge on Root City, you\u2019ll have to be at the top of your game to survive, and you\u2019ll have to surpass your limits if you want to save the world.\n\nBe A Badass: Jet Lancer is easy to learn but hard to master. Precise and responsive controls make you feel like an ACE as you dodge and weave through enemy fire without even a scratch in the paint.\nSurpass your Limits in Ash\u2019s Story: Make your way from rookie aviator to ACE pilot in a story-driven single player campaign containing 30 missions, 11 bosses, and only 1 chance to save the world.\nAggressive New Game Plus: Go higher, further, and faster in Jet Lancer\u2019s New Game Plus mode which features more relentless AI, new attack patterns, and some fancy new upgrades for the LANCE to provide a fresh experience.\nChoose From an Extensive Arsenal: Customizable loadout with 28 different guns, payloads, and flight components to let you dominate the skies in any way you\u2019d like.\nCustomize with Accessibility Options: We think everyone should have the opportunity to feel like an ACE pilot. To that end we\u2019ve included anti-fatigue control toggles, adjustable dodge windows, an invincibility option, and the ability to disable screenshake and screen flashing.\nTalking Cat: There\u2019s a talking cat! His name is Lem.",
