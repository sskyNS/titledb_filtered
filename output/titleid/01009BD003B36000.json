	"description": "Welcome to Thimbleweed Park. Population: 80 nutcases. \n\nA haunted hotel, an abandoned circus, a burnt-out pillow factory, a dead body pixelating under the bridge, toilets that run on vacuum tubes... you\u2019ve never visited a place like this before. \n\nFive people with nothing in common have been drawn to this rundown, forgotten town. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they are all deeply connected. And they\u2019re being watched.\n\n...Who is Agent Ray really working for and will she get what they want?\n...What does Junior Agent Reyes know about a 20 year old factory fire that he\u2019s not saying?\n...Will the ghost, Franklin, get to speak to his daughter again?\n...Will Ransome the *Beeping* Clown ever become a decent human being?\n...Will aspiring game developer Delores abandon her dreams and stick by her family?\n...And most importantly: how come no one cares about that dead body?\n\nBy the end of a long, strange night in Thimbleweed Park, all of this will be answered -- and you\u2019ll question everything you thought you knew.\n\nIn a town like Thimbleweed Park, a dead body is the least of your problems.\n\nKey Features:\nFrom Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, creators of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion.\nA neo-noir mystery set in 1987.\n5 playable characters who can work together\u2026 or get on each other\u2019s nerves.\nNot a walking simulator!\nSatisfying puzzles intertwined with a twisty-turny story that will stay with you.\nA vast, bizarre world to explore at your own pace.\nA joke every 2 minutes... guaranteed!*\nCasual and Hard modes with varied difficulty.\nEnglish voices with English, German, French, Italian, Russian, and Spanish subtitles.\n*Not a guarantee.
