	"description": "\"STEEL WORKER\" is a puzzle game released by TAITO in 1980.\nIn this game, your objective is to connect a path to the destination by placing scaffolding for a workman performing high-altitude work on a construction site, ensuring he does not fall.\nTo prevent the workman from having an accident, it is sometimes necessary to strategically place the scaffolding so that he takes a detour or reverses his path. Remember to value your workers! Stay safe out there!\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpieces that built a generation for video games.\n\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
