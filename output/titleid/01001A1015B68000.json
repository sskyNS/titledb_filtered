This game comes with a \"Nine Heads Mode.\"\nThe number of heads you can use in a stage is limited, but the game is equipped with a \"Nine Heads Mode\" which is worry-free even for people who aren't good with puzzles or action.You can use nine heads in every stage.\n\n\u25bcCharacters are rich in personality and each has their own heartwarming story\nWhen you clear a world, Sekibanki regains her memories of the characters associated with that stage.Will she be able to take back the memories of these fantasy worlds safely? \n\nLet Sekibanki's rather wonderful adventure begin.",
