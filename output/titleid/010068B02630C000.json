	"description": "Thief Simulator 2 will transport you to a world full of valuables, expensive cars, and rustling banknotes. As long as you find a way to steal them.\nKnow that a thief\u2019s trade is not a piece of cake. In order to get some practice, you\u2019ll start with petty theft. This is how you\u2019ll gain the experience required to access more and more risky \u2013 and most importantly, more profitable \u2013 jobs.\n\nGain levels and unlock new possibilities. Get useful tools. Together with newly acquired skills, they will pave the way to expensive items, which you can then sell on the black market. The tools of your trade include a crowbar and binoculars, as well as advanced equipment that becomes available as you progress, such as a laptop for hacking through security systems.\n\nThe creators of Thief Simulator 2 have prepared two unique locations with houses, banks, restaurants, and other special places that you\u2019ll get to strip of money, valuables, and other items. But before you do, examine the surroundings: find out when the building empties out, learn the tenants\u2019 or the employees\u2019 schedule. Then you just need to prepare a strategy and it\u2019s gone time.\n\nJust be quick and efficient. You don\u2019t have much time, so you\u2019ll need to immediately assess which item to take and which one to leave. Can you handle the pressure, or will you panic?\n\nRemember to keep your eyes around your head. Even the best plan can fall apart, and the local police are just waiting for a chance to put you in handcuffs. Don\u2019t get caught. Always be one step ahead of law enforcement.\nMake sure to work on cars between robbing buildings. Start with small family sedans and make gradual steps towards mastery, which will allow you to steal the coolest sports cars.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n    \u2022 Two neighborhoods, with over 20 houses to break into. Learn tenants\u2019 routines, pick the right time to break in, and then rob them.\n    \u2022 Five heists, each with a unique location. Make your way into a resort with 6 houses full of loot, a warehouse crawling with guards, and a central bank with gold waiting to be snatched from the vault.\n    \u2022 Two game modes \u2013 choose between Story Mode with a full narrative, or Free Mode for unrestricted exploration and theft.\n    \u2022 Get better and better tools, ranging from a crowbar or binoculars to hacking laptops, stethoscopes, etc.\n    \u2022 Make your way into houses undetected, or run in wielding a baton and knock everyone out. Alternatively, put them to sleep using sleeping gas or a tranquilizer gun. The choice is up to you.\n    \u2022 Payphone missions \u2013 rob certain locations in a specified amount of time.\n    \u2022 Over 15 contracts requiring you to steal unique items.\n    \u2022 Level up your thief and acquire new skills, which opens up new possibilities. Learn special skills, and activate unique abilities.\n    \u2022 Escape the police \u2013 intense chases with police cars and helicopters. Be careful not to get shot.\n    \u2022 Upgrade your car, change its color, give it more power \u2013 or just buy a sports car and leave the police behind.\n    \u2022 Steal cars \u2013 begin with a small, family sedan, and work your way up to a sports dream car.\n    \u2022 Devil's Lair \u2013 they say the devil resides here. Time seems not to pass normally. Apparently the previous owner left some valuable belongings before his disappearance. Can you retrieve them, before you vanish as well?\n    \u2022 Futuristic Museum \u2013 very expensive art and jewelry are stored here for all to see, but not for all to take. You might be the exception. It's a quite heavily guarded building, though.",
