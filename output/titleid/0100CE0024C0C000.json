	"description": "In White Knuckle Ascent, speed is your best friend\u2014and gravity your worst enemy. Trapped in the depths of a massive underground megastructure, you\u2019ll need sharp reflexes, clever inventory management, and a serious lack of fear of heights to make your way up through a labyrinth of decaying industrial zones, mutated flora, and things that definitely don\u2019t want you to leave.\n\nMaster physics-driven, momentum-based movement to fling, swing, and claw your way up shifting terrain. Use tools wisely or get weighed down\u2014because the wrong gear at the wrong time can drag you straight to your doom.\n\nEach run is a fresh climb. Unlock strange augmentations, adapt to increasingly bizarre threats, and survive environments like the slime-slick Pipeworks or the creaking husks of the forgotten Habitation sector. And always\u2014always\u2014keep climbing. Something is down there. It knows you\u2019re here. And it really doesn\u2019t like quitters.\n\nSo tighten your grip. The only way out\u2026 is up.",
