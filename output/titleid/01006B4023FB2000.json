	"description": "Zumba World \u2013 The Lost Marble Island combines classic marble-shooter action with an interactive island adventure! You play as a masked tiki warrior, mouth brimming with vibrant marbles. Dash through a top-down tiki hub\u2014sprinkled with hidden treasure chests and level portals\u2014to choose your next challenge.\nOnce you select a stage, position your warrior at the center of winding jungle paths and launch marbles to match three or more identical orbs. Trigger dazzling chain reactions, clear waves swiftly, and earn up to three stars by preventing any marble from slipping past the ruins\u2019 thresholds.\nEvery ten levels, dash back into the hub world and venture deeper into one of four exotic island realms\u2014Sunlit Beach Temples, Overgrown Canopy Ruins, Steamy Volcano Springs, and the Sacred Moonlit Lagoon\u2014each with new marble colors, winding vine-carved paths, moving tribal barriers, and ever-quickening speeds.\nNo two expeditions are alike: discover secret shortcuts in the hub, unlock bonus mini-stages, and collect ancient tiki tokens that reveal the Lost Marble Island\u2019s hidden lore. Addictive and richly themed, Zumba World \u2013 The Lost Marble Island invites you to master marble magic and become the ultimate tiki champion!\n",
