	"description": "Story\nIn the near future, a sudden proliferation of plants has left much of human civilization drowning in greenery. Yuuto is a boy living in a city that's now largely reclaimed by nature. One day, a girl named Kanade appears on his doorstep.\nThe two had been exchanging letters after she found one of his carrier pigeons.\n\"I have to sing the greatest love song and save the world in my mother's place.\nSo, Yuuto-san... Would you please fall in love with me?\"\nWarmly watched over by those around them, the two tentatively begin their exploration of love. What neither of them realize is that a spark of affection has already budded between them...\nFall in love, make music, and save the world.\nThis is the tale of a wondrous future where the encounter between a boy and girl brings a miracle to the world.",
