	"description": "A vast and mysterious world lies before you, one that hides the truth of your existence and echoes the memory of past lives. As the tenth game created by Tongu\u00e7 Bodur, Drizzlepath: Deja Vu is a reimagining of his first creation, a standalone experience accessible by any kind of player.\n\nIn Drizzlepath: Deja Vu, you\u2019ll take the role of a nameless man climbing towards a mountaintop in search of answers. Witness events as you explore, each gradually adding to the larger existential narrative. Ponder the enigmatic and cyclical nature of memory through abstract storytelling and beautifully detailed environments, punctuated by ominous imagery that\u2019s more mysterious than it is frightening, a beacon to guide you forward.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Enjoy a relaxing walking simulator with events triggered by exploration.\n\u2022 Navigate in a first-person perspective.\n\u2022 Journey through lush 3D landscapes, often familiar and occasionally surreal or ominous.\n\u2022 Discover secrets hidden throughout an expansive and seamless map.\n\u2022 Experience a thought-provoking narrative about life and existence.\n",
