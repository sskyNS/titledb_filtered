	"description": "He's cute! But also strong! This is an orthodox fighting game in which you control such a beastman and fight against him. Chemo rating!\n\nThere are only five basic attacks required to fight: weak attack, medium attack, strong attack, special attack, and throw. Each character also has only 5 special moves.\n\nThis tutorial demo allows you to actually watch the movements of a character performing special moves, etc., while confirming the information input in real time.\nTraining mode with hit detection visualization, record function, etc.\nThe options can be adjusted to extend the grace period for accepting prior input of commands...and other specifications that are friendly to beginners of fighting games.\n\nThe guard crash status and remaining HP are carried over to the next round.\nThe game also features Auto Advancing Guard (AAG), a rare system that automatically separates the distance between opponents when guarding, depending on the amount of the AAG gauge.\nThis allows for ad-lib tactics that prevent monotony in sparring, and naturally creates a situation where it is easy to lose if you keep running away while defending.\n\nThe game is simple while incorporating a fresh system without losing the fundamentals of a fighting game. The content is designed to make everyone from beginners to advanced players want to fight fair and square with excitement.",
