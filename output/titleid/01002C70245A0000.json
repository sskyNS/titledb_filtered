	"intro": "A Hugo Award-winning science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations.",
	"description": "Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth? \n\nDo anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.\n\nDEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION \u2014 Don\u2019t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.\n\nFULLY SIMULATED CREATURES \u2014 Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.\n\nDYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM \u2014 Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.\n\nRICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING \u2014 Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.\n\nTACTICAL GAMEPLAY \u2014 Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.\n\nRPG ELEMENTS \u2014 Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.\n\nATMOSPHERIC ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK \u2014 Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.\n\nCaves of Qud has one of the most expressive character creators of all time.\n\nPlay the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes \u2014 the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.\n\nBuild your character out of:\n\n- Over 70 mutations \u2014 outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself\u2026\n\n- Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure) \u2014 night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons\u2026\n\n - 24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra\u2019yi, the Great Salt Desert\n\n - Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of 9 preset characters and start your adventure right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.\n\nPlay one of four modes:\n\nCLASSIC \u2014 Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.\n\nROLEPLAY \u2014 Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.\n\nWANDER \u2014 Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don\u2019t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.\n\nDAILY \u2014 One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?",
