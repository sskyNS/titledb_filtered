	"description": "Improve your putting skills at home with training software supervised by professional golfers!\n\n\u25bc Three Practice Modes to Improve Your Putting\n1. Solidify Your Form\nPractice on a flat surface, focusing on putting the ball into the cup from a distance of 0.5m to 5m.\nYou can solidify your form by paying attention to the angle and practicing repeatedly.\nThe putter face angle, ball initial speed, and other factors are measured for each stroke, which can help improve your form.\n\n2. Develop a Sense of Distance\nYou will practice long-distance putts in three situations: flat, uphill, and downhill, focusing on getting the ball close to the cup.\nYou will get a sense of distance by hitting the ball at distances of 5m, then 7.5m, 10m, 12.5m, and 15m.\nYou can also select a distance that you are not good at and practice it intensively.\nThe longer the distance, the more important the face angle becomes.\n\n3. Train Your Sense of Slope\nOn a sloping green, practice putting from a circle around the cup at distances of 0.5m to 3m, moving clockwise to experience different slopes.\nThe average angle of inclination to the cup can also be set to three levels.\nUsing the terrain guide, you will understand the differences in how the ball rolls.\nBy practicing repeatedly, you will develop a sense of slope.\n\n\u25bcTwo Unique Practice Styles\nIn Standard style, play with the TV or Nintendo Switch\u2122 console in front of you, making it easy to judge distance and slope as if you were standing on the green.\nIn Ground style, place the Nintendo Switch\u2122 console on the floor. The ball\u2019s position is displayed on the ground, letting you check the impact point as you putt\u2014just like real putting.\n\n\u25bcSupport Features\nTake on fun game modes that put your daily practice to the test.\nIncludes Daily Missions with new challenges each day, and a One-Putt Game where you aim for the best score in a single stroke.\nYour practice results are automatically saved and can be reviewed anytime.\nLeft-handed play supported.",
