	"description": "The rules are the same as rock-paper-scissors.\nThere's no real opponent \u2014 you're fighting against NPCs.\n\nThree gauges gradually decrease over time. During the 60-second battle, tap three different commands to launch attacks.\nTapping a command restores the gauge of the corresponding color, so it\u2019s best to prioritize the ones that are running low.\n\nThis is a reflex-based challenge where you fight while keeping an eye on all three bars.\nWith a simple rule of \u201csurvive for 60 seconds,\u201d it's easy for both kids and adults to pick up and play.\n\nYour combo count is auto-saved, so aim to beat your personal best!\n\nThere are also voice lines for different times of day, and special shoutouts when you pull off combos!
