	"description": "Caput Mortum is a short first-person horror experience inspired by retro 3D dungeon crawlers and survival horror games. Delve into a tower of forgotten nightmares, where every step could be your last. Overcome horrors from beyond death and unlock the secrets of forbidden knowledge.\n\nClose the lights, put on headphones, and immerse yourself in the game's macabre world. Behind every door lurks a new terror, and in every corner a key to some eldritch secret. Pay close attention to your surroundings, overcome unique puzzles, and piece together the events that took place within the tower. How deep are you willing to go, and what terrible truths will you uncover?\n\nYou must stay vigilant, as varied monsters roam the abandoned halls of the tower and won't hesitate to attack. Stealth past them, fight back, or perhaps... something else? Just be mindful of your health. There are only so many healing items in the game. This is old school, remember?",
