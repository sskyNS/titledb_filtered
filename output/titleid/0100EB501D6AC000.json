	"intro": "New concept of solitaire! \nThe cards are simply numbered 1 to 100.",
	"description": "This is the digital version of a catchy card game called \u2018Re: Cento\u2019 designed by Inaba Naoki, world famouse as the inovator of Area Maze puzzles.\n\n\u25a0The game is both simple and exciting!\nLike \u2018Old Maid\u2019, you draw a card from the player to your left but where it gets exciting is you can force opponents to pick up cards while avoiding having cards forced into your hand. \nThe player who empties his/her hand first wins.\n\n\u25a0It requires memory, logical thinking, and good luck to win.\n\n\u25a0Basic Rules\nStep1. On your turn, you draw a card from the player to your left and place the card face up on the table. \nStep2. Then you place a card from your hand on the table. \nStep3. The other players can place cards which have numbers between those two cards on the table. You have to receive the cards placed on the table by the other players. \nStep4. It is now the next player\u2019s turn. In this way the game continues, the player who empties his/her hand first is the winner.\n\nGive it a try and you will soon get the hang of it.",
