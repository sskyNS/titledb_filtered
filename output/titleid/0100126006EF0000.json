	"description": "GOKEN seeks to bring back everything that was right about gaming in an action packed open world environment in the form of the good old Action RPG genre and have the old school gamers tremble in nostalgia.\n\n\n-Scenario-\nLong ago, when gods lived amongst people...\n\nThere lived a swordsman who was given five swords forged by god himself.\n\nUsing these swords, the swordsman brought peace and order to the world. \n\nPeople called the swordsman, \"Wielder of the Five Swords\"...\n\nOne day, during a fete to praise the gods, the blades of the swordsman turn against the gods for reasons unknown.\n\nOne of the gods, Ozone, furious with all his powers, sealed the swordsman away at the top of a mountain now known as Swords Peak.\n\nThis tale begins 5,000 years after the battle between the two, near a the small village of Cardina.\n\n\n-Game Overview-\n\n-Seamless open-world game mechanics\nWhile the game features a rather old school \u201cquarter view\u201d mechanic, the map transitions and event scenes, even the combat is all seamless as can be to enhance the overall gaming experience.\n\n-Real time strategic action battle system\nUtilizing 2 primary attack buttons, users can assign different weapons to each button to create a unique combo that fits the users need as they go. Monsters, bosses and stage gimmicks can require a specific type of weapon at times creating opportunities for users to strategize their best route of approach.\n\n-Customizable Tattoo system\nUtilizing \"tattoos\", users are given specific points upon leveling to get the protagonist inked as a form of powering up so it could be built to one\u2019s own. Raising MAX HP and Stamina, learning new and special moves are just a few of many ways players are able to customize their character depending on their play style.",
