	"description": "RETRO-CLASSIC\nYou remember Klaus Lee, right?! No? Well, you should! He almost became a cop in Beverly Hills but then applied to be a private investigator in Hawaii and got bored waiting to find out if he got it. Moving back to Cali, he worked as an unknown stuntman while running a squad of troubleshooters that kept getting beaten to the clients by A much more successful Team. One time he barely missed his job interview at a New York startup and some dude named Zeddemore got the job as an exterminator of spirits.\nDid you know that Klaus trained Maverick how to both fly his jet and play killer beach volleyball? This is only a glimpse of everything he experienced living life to the max. Klaus was a really busy guy!\n\nFEATURES\n- Classic platforming action with attitude\n- Over 100 levels created by our cruel level designers\n- Build your own levels with the comfortable level editor\n- Share your level creations cross-platform with the world\n- Discover a potentially endless number of user-generated levels",
