	"intro": "Solve cooperative conundrums and unleash brutal betrayals in this local co-op(ish) puzzle platformer!",
	"description": "Lost deep below the earth, trapped in ancient ruins, the two of you must work together to overcome the trials of these forgotten depths and escape. But it\u2019s not all cooperation and teamwork - you each must try to escape with The Jade Statue, a mysterious and ancient relic of untold value. Only one of you can have the relic, and down here? Anything goes.\n\nPuzzle your way through three distinct areas of the ruins, with each offering a distinct set of curious challenges to overcome. Not only that, each area adds new traps, tools, and devious devices to help you get an edge on your \u201cfriend\u201d and secure The Jade Statue. But be careful as you dig deeper through the remnants of this lost civilization - the distant rumbling sounds like you\u2019re not the only ones trapped down here\u2026\n\nUse a Joy-Con\u2122 each to explore Dyadic\u2019s hidden depths with a friend on the go, or grab a single controller to share, opening up new possibilities for twisting, shoving, and other unscrupulous tactics*. But if you want a more traditional experience, don\u2019t worry, you can use two controllers to claw your way out of the underground together instead.\n\n*We are not liable for any broken controllers or broken friendships that result from this.\n",
