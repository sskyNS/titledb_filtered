	"description": "The unique, one tap (and hold) gameplay makes for a simple yet fun experience. The goal is to get your jumping cube character to the bottom of the level, by breaking through orange gates. Players can try their best to move quickly and earn the rocket powerup, which will boost through the platforms automatically. Players lose when the cube doesn\u2019t jump high enough before trying to break through a gate, or when the character hits a white platform.\n\nMain Features include:\n\u2013 Unique gameplay\n\u2013 Level & score system\n\u2013 Player shop\n\u2013 Powerup\n\u2013 Sound effects",
