	"description": "One could say POOLS is like an art gallery where you look around and listen to the sounds. There are very few things to solve apart from a few mazes. Sometimes the game can challenge your navigation skills. But mostly you're just... there.\n\nPOOLS has no user interface and no dialogue. No background music. Instead, it uses sounds to make you feel like you're really there. The sounds and echo change depending on the room you're in. Walking in water is slower. All of these things make the game feel more real and create a tense atmosphere.\n\nThere's no typical story, no characters to meet, and you won't find any notes in-game. But as you explore and advance further, you start to notice that the game's world changes around you. Rooms look and feel different. Each chapter contains something unique. You're constantly exploring new places, each with its own kind of mystery.\n\n\nNote: There are no monsters chasing you or jumping suddenly towards you, but the atmosphere can feel oppressive. POOLS plays on the fears of getting lost, the dark, and tight spaces.\n\nNote: POOLS consists of six unique chapters, each taking between 10 and 30 minutes to play through.\n\n\nPOOLS is inspired by the internet phenomena \"liminal spaces\", \"found footage\" and \"The Backrooms\" - specifically \"Backrooms Pools\" or \"Poolrooms\".\n\nOne of the original artists behind the Poolrooms concept is Jared Pike. Other inspirations include Matt Studios' Poolrooms videos from 2022, Mortain Colors, Anemoiapolis by Andrew Quist and Kane Pixels' Backrooms.",
