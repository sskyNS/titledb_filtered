	"description": "You wake up in a dark room of an old house. The door is locked, the windows are boarded up, and the only way out is deeper into the gloomy building. From this moment, your nightmare begins: the house hides countless secrets, and in its basement lurks Evil Tung Tung Sahur \u2014 a twisted monster hunting you down. Each step brings you closer to the truth, but also to an inevitable encounter with horror. The rooms are filled with strange symbols and puzzles, the corridors whisper stories of the past, and the creaking floorboards and voices in the dark remind you \u2014 you are not alone here. Your survival depends on vigilance and composure: find the keys, solve the puzzles, and avoid a deadly meeting with Evil Tung Tung Sahur, who is always nearby.",
