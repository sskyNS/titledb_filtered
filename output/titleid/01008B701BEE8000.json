Packs contain multiple cards that you can use to expand your village. Every pack has a focus such as Cooking, Farming or Building.\n\nAt the end of every Moon you'll need to feed all your villagers - so make sure you have enough food, or your villagers will starve! \n\nFeatures\n[*] 200+ Cards to collect\n[*] 60+ Ideas to find\n[*] 80+ Quests to complete\n[*] 13 different Card Packs to buy\n[*] 5-7 hours of playtime\n\nCombat\nA Villager bumping into an evil creature will engage in an automatic battle. Fight Goblins, Bears, Rats and more! Improve your Villager's combat abilities by giving them weapons or by making them team up against enemies.\n\nFind Ideas\nExpand your knowledge by finding Idea Cards.
