	"description": "\"The Olders are those things who don't listen to anyone and suddenly get violent, right?\"\n\nThis is the story of children who live just like this, trying to survive and thrive in a world not quite like our own. This is an RPG adventure that will change the way you think about \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cadults\u201d.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nSomewhere, in a secret room, in a secret place, a curious boy flips the switch of a dusty old console. He's suddenly pulled through the screen into a very strange somewhere else: a never-released and long-forgotten retro RPG.\n\nHe blinks awake in a land where only Children live. Outside their stronghold's walls lurk The Olders: monstrous adults carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and the many other grievances that all grown-ups gather. \n\nIt\u2019s here \u2014 in this funny, mysterious, and wildly dangerous domain \u2014 that your story begins.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\n\nAs you explore the world of Stray Children, you\u2019ll do turn-based battle with these oddball Olders. You can choose to fight, or to use your words as weapons, and land a crushing blow with just a well-worded whisper.\n\nDodge the barrage of their bottled-up emotions, and discover the secrets they keep hidden deep inside. By touching their heart with your words, you might just be able to save their souls.\n\nWhat other mysteries await you in this weird new world? Find out in Stray Children \u2014 an unfamiliar place, with all-too-familiar troubles.\n\nONE MORE THING\n\nWe hope you\u2019ll enjoy discovering all the secrets in Stray Children, but we have one request for everyone who finishes the game: please keep the ending a secret! \n",
