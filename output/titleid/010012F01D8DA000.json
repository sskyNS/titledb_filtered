	"description": "Q. What kind of game is it? \nA. Play cards \u2192 Create infinite alpacas \u2192 Your opponent dies\n\n============================================\n\nOverdungeon is a real-time action card game that combines roguelike, tower defense, and card games! It's easy to play with simple controls, is very replayable and a high degree of freedom! Conquer dungeons by combining cards selected from hundreds of cards! Is your trump card an alpaca? Or a dog or a cat? Or maybe a chicken? Build the strongest deck and challenge the dungeon!\n\n\u25a0 Dynamic Deck Building \nDiscover different cards every time you play and choose the best card for the situation! There are tons of unique cards in different categories, such as animals, buildings, spells, and traps! Depending on the combination, you can create a deck with destructive power beyond your imagination!\n\n\u25a0 Silly Cards \nThere are so many silly cards in the game! Have you ever seen a card that summons an alpaca or a card that summons a chicken? What about a card that summons dogs that multiply each time it is summoned? What about a card that doubles all the animals you summon? Have you ever seen a card that uses all the cards in your hand twice? This is a card game where you can do all the things that you would normally think are \"cheating!\"!\n\n\u25a0 A unique Real-Time Action Card Game \nSummoned animals move in real time! However, as long as your turn is in play, the enemy will not summon new animals or attack! You can choose to use the card as it is or choose a location to use it! It's simple to operate, but depending on the card combination, you can use cards infinitely and you can even continue the battle while it's your turn forever!\n\n\u25a0 Roguelike Stages\nA roguelike game needs random elements! Overdungeon \"changes\" every time you play! The cards that appear, the enemies that appear, the events that occur in the dungeon, and the places where you can take a short rest all change every time you play, so there is no two adventures that are exactly the same! Do you prepare a strong card combination and want to fight a tough monster? Or do you want to be on the safe side and take a short break to recover your strength? It's all up to you!\n\n\u25a0 Diverse Relic System\nYou can combine more than just cards! The relic system makes the game even deeper! By combining the effects of relics found in dungeons with the effects of cards, you can make your deck even stronger! What if you combined a relic that summons a chick when you deal damage to an enemy with an attack card that damages the enemy by throwing all the animals on the field at them...?",
