This game stands apart from others in this style by focusing on Cthulhu-centered Lovecraftian elements, bringing them to a present day setting.

Players must help her escape from the ominous perils of the prison by acquiring and using various items, all while protecting Stella from the life-threatening dangers she will face.\n\n- Death lurks around every corner. Don't face it head-on, and don't let your guard down.\n- Collect and use the tools you can find to survive.\n- Items can act as clues to help you escape, but can be fatal if used carelessly, so use them wisely.\n- Each choice is a fork in the road. If you manage to survive, you may see which of three endings you have attained.",
