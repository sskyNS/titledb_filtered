	"description": "Kaimyou is ...\n\nKaimyou is a posthumous name given to a deceased person in Buddhist tradition, particularly in Japan. It is used during memorial services and placed on the Ihai (memorial tablet) in honor of the deceased. The Kaimyou represents the individual\u2019s spiritual journey and is usually bestowed by a Buddhist priest. The name often reflects the person\u2019s virtues or spiritual aspirations, and its creation follows specific religious customs. The use of Kaimyou is common in rituals surrounding death, mourning, and the afterlife, and it plays a significant role in the commemoration of ancestors.\n\nThis software automatically generates Kaimyou (posthumous Buddhist names).\n*Please note that while the term 'Kaimyou' is used as a general reference, in the software, the name may be referred to as 'Houmyou,' 'Hougou,' 'Myougou,' 'Okurina,' or other terms depending on the Buddhist sect.\n\nThis comprehensive Kaimyou editing tool is suitable not only for those who wish to receive a Kaimyou for themselves or their family members, but also for use by Buddhist priests. Additionally, since Japanese religions are tolerant, the software can be used by individuals from other religions without any issue. Even if you simply want a cool Kanji alias, you are welcome to use it.\n\n\n\nMain Features\n\n\u25a0 Automatic Kaimyou Generation\nBy simply answering questions and inputting the following profile information\u2014name, gender, age, sect, level of faith, occupation, hobbies, skills, and motto\u2014the Kaimyou will be automatically generated.\n\n\u25a0 Flexible Editing\nYou can freely modify the automatically generated Kaimyou. Changes can be made at the Kanji level while checking their meanings, allowing you to receive a Kaimyou that meets your preferences.\n\n\u25a0 Kaimyou Certificate Issuance\nOnce you have your favorite Kaimyou, you can issue a certificate. The certificate can be saved in an album, enabling you to transfer it to other devices or print it for use.\n\n\u25a0 As an Ihai\nBy switching your Nintendo Switch\u2122 to tabletop mode, it can be used as an Ihai. The Ihai is a memorial tablet that represents the deceased.\n\n\u25a0 Temple Member Management\nThe software includes a temple member management feature, allowing you to manage multiple individuals\u2019 names, ages, sects, and more. This makes it highly recommended for clergy who need to manage Kaimyou for multiple people.\n\n\u25a0 Supported Sects\n\u30fbJ\u014ddo-sh\u016b / SeizanJ\u014ddo-sh\u016b / J\u014ddoShin-sh\u016b / Shinsh\u016bTakada-Ha\n\u30fbNichiren-sh\u016b / NichirenSei-sh\u016b\n\u30fbS\u014dt\u014d-sh\u016b / Rinzai-sh\u016b / \u014cbaku-sh\u016b\n\u30fbShingon-sh\u016b / Tendai-sh\u016b / Y\u016bz\u016bNembutsu-sh\u016b\n\u30fbJi-sh\u016b\n\u30fbRitsu-sh\u016b\n\u30fbShinto\n\u30fbNo religion / Unknown\n",
