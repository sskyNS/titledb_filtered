	"description": "\"Pnevmo-Capsula\" is a casual adventure game. You will travel to an alternate utopian atompunk world as a small trolley delivering mail.\n\nTime seems to have stopped at the break of 1930-1960 years here. The city is connected by a single system of rails, tracks, and pipes. The smallest part of this bizarre system is the mechanical mail.\n\nThe mail here is delivered by carts on small rails, and you will play the role of one of these carts. On the way towards the target, you will find obstacles, barriers, various puzzles, dead ends and labyrinths.\n\nAs the player progresses, he will come across outlandish living spaces-puzzles: the \"caretaker's booth\" on a power pole, made of sleepers; \"Air platform\" with houses at a height; \"The artist's hut\", fixed directly on the power line! With all the wildness of ideas, the player on an intuitive level will understand the purpose of the objects and their functionality.",
