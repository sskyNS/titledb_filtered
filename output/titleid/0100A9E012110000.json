	"description": "LOCAL MAYHEM\nOutwit and outplay your friends in first-to-3 style matches. Joust with your pals; only one can remain victorious on the battlefield.\nAction packed and super fast, each round is a quick fight, great for passing the controller at parties.\n\nEASY TO LEARN, HARD TO MASTER\nSimple stick controls are used to maneuver your vehicle, and two buttons to either jump over your opponents or smash them into the air! The controls are easy, but learning to outwit and bait your friends is the fun part.\n\nSIX CHARACTERS, SO MANY HATS\nChoose your warrior, from the not-so-sweet Nigiri to the gruff Business Toast. Find a hat that truly speaks to you (and try not to lose it in the rush of battle). Pick a paint job that makes your heart sing.\n\nFOUR ARENAS\nRanging from a peaceful stony outcropping to a deadly lava lair, pick an arena that will challenge you and your friends.\n\nTEAM UP\nPlay against some rather friendly or vicious AI; great for blowing off steam or getting some practice in.",
