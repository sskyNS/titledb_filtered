	"intro": "As a kid, have you ever imagined being an air traffic controller, managing the flights of hundreds of toy planes and passengers?",
	"description": "In this game, you control a miniature toy airport, and your job is to avoid crashes. The fate of all the planes, cars, taxis, and passengers is in your hands. \n\nEach level is a beautiful and intricate clockwork machine, waiting for its players. Up to four players can team up and control the airport together, or you can play solo and see how good you are.\n\nIf you like games that are easy to pick up, but hard to master, you will love Airport. It's a game that will make you feel like a kid again, playing with your favorite toys on the carpet. \n\nAirport has more than 50 levels of increasing difficulty and complexity, each with its own objectives and challenges. If you are looking for even more brain-teasers, you can try the unlockable hard mode, which will test your skills and coordination even more.\n\nAirport is available now on Nintendo Switch\u2122, so grab your controllers and get ready for takeoff!",
