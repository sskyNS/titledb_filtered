	"description": "Alan Shaw\u2019s daughter is missing, and the only one capable of helping him locate her may be a small mouse named Quintus. Join this odd pairing on their search for answers, using the differences in their size as an advantage.\n\nQuintus and the Absent Truth is a horror-themed adventure told in first-person perspective. Puzzles that Alan and Quintus encounter often require you to work out which character to use for the task at hand. Do you need Alan\u2019s height to reach buttons, switches and items that are out of Quintus\u2019 reach, or is a hole simply too tight for Alan to fit through? Only by working together can they discover the truth that they seek.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Experience a narrative-rich horror adventure in first person!\n\u2022 Alternate between man and mouse to navigate riddling environments.\n\u2022 Solve puzzles across 4 main chapters!\n\u2022 Immerse yourself in a unique 3D visual style.\n\u2022 Discover a museum of secrets upon completing the story!\n",
