	"description": "How may a resenting and alcoholic household affect a little girl full of imagination? How may she perceive the twisted and manipulative family dynamics?\n\nGrow up with Lydia and try to understand the feelings, behaviours and events that moulded critical moments of her life. Confront the monster with your own sensitivity.\n\nThis hand-drawn game can be completed in around one hour. The emotional music was composed by renowned film composer Juhana Lehtiniemi.\n\nThe issues reflected in this story unfortunately happen in real people\u2019s daily life. You can provide some help by donating to the \"Fragile Childhood\" foundation via the DLC #LydiaDonation. \n\n\u2022 \"Lydia is an important game, not just because it broaches an important subject matter, but for how it uses its art direction, music, and storytelling to highlight the issues it's bringing to our attention.\" GodisaGeek\n\u2022 \"It successfully tells a haunting story about abuse and heartbreak without necessarily shoving it down your throat, and that\u2019s really hard to do.\" Nintendo Life\n\u2022 \"Lydia is a small game, but it sends a bigger message...\" Pure Nintendo\n\nDEVELOPED BY Platonic Partnership\n\u201cOur Finnish studio is focusing on narrative-driven games that motivate change. Lydia is someone who wishes for a happy childhood but can never have it. People with similar experiences will see this, so hopefully the game is really genuine and respectful.\u201d \u2013 Henri Tervapuro, graphic novel artist and co-author of this self-inspired story.\n\nPUBLISHED BY Nakana.io \n\u201cWe gather games that share a strong experience to remember. We try to grow real changes from the seeds of their message, like with the #LydiaDonation DLC.\u201d \u2013 Mika\u00ebl Bourget, founder of the publishing label.",
