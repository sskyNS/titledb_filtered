Take control of a bundled-up pixel art climber as they make their way across icefields, up frosted peaks, through dark caves and over treacherous pitfalls! Help them survive mysterious hazards and overcome brain-teasing obstacles that span 40 unique levels.\n\nThe objective is simple, to navigate single-screen challenges from entry to exit, then warp to the next level of escalating complexity. Locate and unlock warp points by activating switches, opening doors and finding special crystals. You\u2019ll even be able to form ice blocks to help you negotiate dangerous gaps or reach high ledges. Stack them on top of one another, knock them over or toss them on top of spikes and switches. And if you get in a tight spot or plummet off a cliff, no worries! You can restart at the beginning of any level you\u2019ve reached, allowing you to try again or go for better times.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Experience a chill adventure through puzzling landscapes.\n\u2022 Run and jump through 40 levels of increasing challenge!\n\u2022 Form ice blocks to navigate terrain or avoid deadly hazards.\n\u2022 Enjoy cute pixel art graphics with a wintry aesthetic!",
