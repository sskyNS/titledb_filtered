	"description": "Gurgamoth is the perfect mix of party chaos and competitive strategy, ideal for sitting around on the couch with a couple of friends.  \n\nYour only weapon is the level itself: a shifting battlefield with different hazards.  Gurgamoth is fast, relying on quick timing, but also your ability to read your opponent.  Will they dodge your attack and send you flying into a spinning saw blade?  Will they spend their attacks on a power-up, leaving them temporarily vulnerable?  Will they anticipate your attack and stun you while you're recovering?\n\nGet inside their minds and earn the honor of awakening Gurgamoth.\n\nGurgamoth features:\n\u2022Unique levels, each with their own dangers.\n\u2022Game-changing power-ups.\n\u2022Tight flying mechanics.\n\u2022Fantastic visual design.\n\u2022Fast, party-friendly matches.\n\u2022Face killer bots.\n\u2022The most fun you'll have summoning an elder god.",
