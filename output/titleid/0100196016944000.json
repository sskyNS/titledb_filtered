	"description": "Touhou Project derivative bullet hell game is now on Nintendo Switch\u2122!\n\nYou may dodge like you always do in Touhou official games, or strategize it like playing an RPG! The choice is yours!\nWhile dodging rains is important, whether you win or lose is entirely on your fairy party!\nIs it game over? Nobody knows until the very end!\n\n\u25a0Story\nMap Orb Game, a game that gained immense popularity in Gensokyo at the end of the year. It's a game where players capture fairies with dichromatic balls named \"Map Orb\" and use them to fight over territories for their factions.\nMap Orbs can be obtained from marked spots all over Gensokyo. Because of their wide distribution and rising popularity, humans are starting to step into the mountain's depths, and youkai are intruding into villages non-stop just to get the orbs.\nAs the situation escalated, three humans readied themselves to deal with it:\nReimu Hakurei, a shrine maiden whose responsibility is to maintain the order of Gensokyo.\nMarisa Kirisame, a magician who simply wants to study unknown games.\nAnd... Sumireko Usami, a high school girl who knows better than anyone about starting incidents that spread balls.",
