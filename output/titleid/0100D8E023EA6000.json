	"description": "This is an action RPG released in Japan by T&E SOFT in 1989, and it is a powered-up version of \u201cHydlide 3\u201d released in 1987. Players take on the role of an adventurer embarking on a journey to save Fairyland from crisis.\n\nAt the start, players create their own character through a character-making system, where they can choose from classes such as swordsman or priest. Each class has unique parameter characteristics. Repeating the character creation process until you\u2019re satisfied can give you an advantage and is considered the first step to success\u2014and part of the fun.\n\n\u201c3\u201d inherits the graphics and sound from \u201c2\u201d but also improves the action elements\u2014replacing body-check attacks with an attack button. Also, the game introduces new features such as class selection, the time, eating, and item weight, making it a well-balanced. This version includes added visual scenes, new maps, and new characters, offering more enjoyable experience. A classic loved by action RPG fans\u2014give it a try.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
