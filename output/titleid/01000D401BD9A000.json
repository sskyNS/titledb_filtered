Every hero plays differently, and requires a fresh approach to their powers and abilities. Learning and exploiting each hero's unique play style will build their power in combat allowing them to unleash their personal tide turning Ultimates.\n\nTURN BASED TACTICS\nExciting, heroic, turn based combat to test your strategic skills.
