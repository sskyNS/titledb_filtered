	"description": "Dear Potential servant of chaos,\n\nBeing evil isn\u2019t always easy\u2026 But boy it is so much more fun than being a good guy!\n\nHaving someone witty like you on my team could be useful during these not so dark times. \n\nEverything in Darkestville was fine and dandy: I was tormenting the town people, the town people were being tormented\u2026 It was a fair deal! Who could complain? Not me, that\u2019s for sure!\n\n\u2026until that moron, Dan Teapot, hired a group of professional demon hunters to banish me! I don\u2019t even know why he has a grudge against me. Maybe I burnt his house a couple of times, but I only did it because it was hilarious! \n\nAnyway.\n\nHelp me in this adventure to best my foes and let\u2019s make evil reign Darkestville once more!\n\nAlso by purchasing this game you are helping a noble cause, part of your money will be used to enslave mankind\u2026 I mean\u2026  to clean the seas from pollution, create a sanctuary for the only Endangered Invisible Flamingo on this planet and other kind of noble sounding lies. \n\nSincerely Evil,\nCid\n\nP.S. So you\u2019re trembling with fear already, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s the spirit! Because this game is not only TERRIBLY interesting but also TERRIBLY funny! If you ever enjoyed Tim Schafer\u2019s classic adventure games and are fond of the Time Burton\u2019s black humor, we\u2019re about to go along with you as these two Tims are my bros.\n\nSure I wouldn\u2019t be Cid if I didn\u2019t add a couple of dozens of the cunning puzzles so don\u2019t you wait a cakewalk. They say it takes seven hours to complete this game\u2026 Well let\u2019s see if you can do it! I trust you can though \u2013 my incredible charm and fascinating sense of style are more than enough to overcome any challenge!\n\nP.P.S. While you were reading this, someone just rang the doorbell of my castle and left a box with an \u201cINDIE PRIZE - Best Game Narrative\u201d tag on it. Well\u2026 just another acknowledgment of my incomparable awesomeness!",
