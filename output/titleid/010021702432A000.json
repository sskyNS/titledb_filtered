	"intro": "In Dawnfolk, you will explore an uncharted medieval fantasy world, manage resources, build cities, and survive against many dangers. ",
	"description": "In a world of darkness, you are the ruler of a kingdom lost to shadows. On a quest to save your people, you have found the mythical creature called \u201cLueur,\u201d a fiery companion who will light your way. But what kind of ruler will you be?\n\nEvery choice matters as you explore different strategies and play styles in Dawnfolk.\n\nMinigames add a unique challenge to supporting your people. The better you are at the minigames, the more resources you get and the more likely your community will weather the darkness. \n\nNot everyone has time to invest hundreds of hours into learning how to play a grand strategy game. You can dive right in and start building your settlement immediately, going from a handful of tents to a big city in less than an hour. \n\nDecades ago, titanic obsidian monoliths rained down from the sky. A raging tempest of unfathomable darkness gathered around them, slowly crawling across the world and consuming all in its path. You are the ruler of this land, once mighty and resolute, now broken and wounded. But not defeated! You intend to reclaim the realm and bring back light to the world.\n\nAfter years of wandering, your story begins as you finally find the Lueur, a mythical creature able to radiate a powerful enough brightness to dissipate darkness. It is time to explore the shadows and rebuild your realm.\n\nYour choices determine the fate of your realm and its inhabitants.\n\nWill you turn a blind eye to impending disasters, or will you face them head-on? How will you handle the tough moral choices that define your legacy? Can you grow and optimize your cities not just survive, but to thrive as a shining beacon for future settlers?\n\nWill you succeed in bringing light back to the world?",
