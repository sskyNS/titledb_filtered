	"description": "Builder Simulator is a game for those, whose biggest dream always was to construct your own house from scratch. Prepare your plan, buy needed materials, and build a perfect residence brick by brick. Will it be an easy task? At first, yes! After all, you\u2019re just a rookie in this serious building industry. A specially made tutorial will guide you step by step through the twists and turns of construction work. However, the more experience you get, the more demanding the challenges become.\n\nBUILD\n\nHave you finished your little design? Good! Now it\u2019s time to put it into practice. Grab a bunch of bricks, take some cement, roll up your sleeves, and build, construct, and create! Are you afraid it\u2019ll be boring? No, no, no. Nothing like that! You\u2019ll dig the foundation, erect walls, insert windows or doors, and many more. It will not only be exciting, but above all, it will be fun!\n\nFINISH\n\nYou\u2019re very proud of those straight walls and perfect roof\u2026 but it\u2019s not over! It\u2019s time to finish this pretty, little house. How? Of course, by polishing its exterior! It\u2019s like putting makeup on a perfectly sculpted face. You can finish the elevation, do the floor or paint walls. Do everything you can to make this house splendid!\n\nDESIGN\n\nEvery big construction project starts with a pencil and a piece of paper. And so, it is in the Builder Simulator. You\u2019ll start your work by designing a house on a drawing board. Lines, curves, squares \u2013 the whole layout is up to your taste.  The only thing that can hold you back is your own imagination. So use this head of yours and draw the most excellent building of it all! And if you don't have an idea for a design, you can always choose one of the projects we have prepared.\n\nSHARE\n\nLeaving this creation to rot on your computer would be such a waste, right? That\u2019s why we prepare something special for all our precious players \u2013 the Community Builder! This is a place where you can share your projects. You can also build a house based on someone else\u2019s project. Show your creations, admire the works of people from all over the world and meet other building freaks! Just share your passion and most importantly\u2026\n\n\u2026HAVE FUN!",
