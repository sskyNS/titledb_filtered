	"description": "Step into abandoned rooms where whispers crawl along the walls and shadows refuse to behave. Your job isn\u2019t to shoot first\u2014it\u2019s to investigate, identify what\u2019s haunting the place, and perform the right rituals before fear, doubt, or something far worse overwhelms you.\n\nSearch for signs of possession, gather sacred tools, and piece together what kind of entity you\u2019re dealing with. Every spirit behaves differently, every location tells a story, and one wrong ritual can turn a cleansing into a catastrophe.\n\nThis is survival through knowledge, nerves, and preparation. The horror creeps slowly, testing your focus as much as your courage. Stay calm, follow the rites, and remember\u2014panic is exactly what the demon wants.\n\nBecause sometimes the scariest part isn\u2019t what\u2019s haunting the house\u2026\nit\u2019s whether you\u2019re strong enough to send it away.",
