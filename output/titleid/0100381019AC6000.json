	"description": "In this cosmic puzzle adventure, help a lost tribe of duck-people in their millennial quest for a stable world!\n\nIn Space Ducks: The great escape, complete challenging Sokoban-like puzzles, by moving the Space Ducks in the right sequence, in order to reach the power source their ship requires and travel to the next planet. \nBut tread lightly, as walking on loose ground will propel into space what ever is standing on the other side. One duck's progress could mean another duck\u00b4s demise!\nAnd even if a duck goes solo (years of living on precarious planets have turned the ducks into a somewhat callous people), remember that their is no escaping gravity and that one false move could bring your mission to a crashing conclusion.\n\nFeatures:\n- Help a tribe of duck-people escape 18+ puzzle planets,\n- Travel across a colorful galaxy and visit 3 biomes,\n- Learn and master original Sokoban inspired mechanics\n- Harness gravity to reshape the planets to your needs\n- Coordinate the ducks' efforts (or let them die trying)\n- Enjoy the retro-classical art, dark humor and original music ",
