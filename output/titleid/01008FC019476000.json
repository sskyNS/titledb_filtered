	"intro": "Billiards is a very ancient and popular board game in which you have to show your skills of dexterity and accuracy.",
	"description": "In our billiards you can play both with a virtual opponent and with friends on one device! Challenge a friend to a duel and compete with him in skill, dexterity and accuracy, because only these skills will help you achieve victory!\n\nThe rules of the game are simple - pocket all the balls of the same color into the holes and end the match with the final black ball to defeat your opponent. But if the rules are simple, then the process itself will make you sweat, because in order to score all the balls faster than your opponent, you will have to show miracles of dexterity and accuracy. A correctly calculated trajectory will help you to quickly pocket your balls, and if you're lucky, even several balls in one shot!\n\nIf there were no friends nearby, then you can play with a virtual opponent by selecting the desired difficulty. If you are a beginner, choose an easy one and train to improve your skill. And if you are a pro, then challenge the virtual opponent on a high level of difficulty and prove that you are a billiards master!\n\nKey features:\n\u2022 Several levels of difficulty when playing with a virtual opponent;\n\u2022 Control via Joy-Con\u2122\ufe0f controller or touch screen;\n\u2022 Nice stylized graphics\n\u2022 Ability to play with friends on the same device!",
