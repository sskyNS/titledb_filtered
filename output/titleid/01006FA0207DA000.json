	"description": "A Brand New Horizon\n\nWelcome to the newest chapter of the Duck Life series, Duck Life 9, where the ducks are still finding new ways to do what they do best - honing their skills and racing their way to the top! Touch down on the tropical archipelago of Featherhaven Island and set up shop in your own little town, ready to rise up the ranks and become the fastest flock there is!\n\n\nDifferent Duck stats\n\nGet ready to cultivate the most talented bunch of ducks any farmer has ever had! Start your flock from selection of different eggs, each with unique skill bonuses that affect how well they can utilise their skill levels during races. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, before we hotfoot it to the races it's time to get your newly-hatched duck to grips with some training!\n\n\nTraining\n\nBecoming the champion won't be easy, though, as this is hardly a simple matter of training alone. Feed and clothe your ducks to help boost their stats, and then race every challenger you can find! The island itself is filled with many tricky tasks to overcome, and without fully exploring each of the 9 areas that surround your humble settlement, you won't stand a chance against the mysterious challenger that looms atop the volcano...\n\n\n9 Island locations\n\nDiscover an expansive, vibrant new 3D world sporting luscious meadows, dazzling crystal plains, a floating city and much more. As your ducks broaden their horizons, you mustn't be afraid to delve a little deeper and discover the secrets that these areas hide, from jelly coins to buried treasure - you never know what could be lurking around each and every corner!\n\n\n\nBuild your town\n\nAs your ambitions grow, so does your flock. Over time you can take your home from a humble campsite to a fully-fledged village, sporting shops, housing, decorations and other interconnected systems that allow the inhabitants to talk to each other and level up their skills. Start your own farm to have more food and drink to go around, or create a town square where learned ducks can stand atop a soapbox and impart their knowledge - it's up to you!\n\n\nBecome the tournament champion \n\nFilling your flock with a rich mix of feathered friends will help to strengthen the overall group. It's going to be a team effort if you want to topple the competition! Use your best swimmers for the swimming leg of the race, and your best climbers for the mountainous peaks. You're only as good as your worst player, so remember to treat all of your ducks with care, and you'll surely see the fruits of your efforts blossom into a truly remarkable team of ducks!",
