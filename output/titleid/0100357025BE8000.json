	"description": "This is an action role-playing game released by T&E SOFT in 1991. Players embark on an adventure as the protagonist, Leen Kashua, in a world where the power of the gods, <Sale>, is gradually fading.\n\nThe game, presented in a top-down view, takes you through dungeons and towns on the field map. The world incorporates time, with a day being 32 hours and a year 16 months.\n\nMany cite the serious scenario and presentation as the defining feature. Lacking humorous scenes or cut-ins by deformed characters, the atmosphere is intensely serious, allowing for an understated narrative. It's highly recommended for those seeking a serious fantasy experience. As this is part of a trilogy, consider playing through the entire series.\n\n \n *The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n *Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
