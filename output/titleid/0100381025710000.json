	"description": "Guide vampires through centuries of emotional baggage, decades of delusions and the odd bout of self-loathing with real cognitive behavioral therapy concepts and become a Vampire Therapist! Even vampires need a shoulder to cry on when a neck to bite just won\u2019t do.\n\nSTORY\nVampire Therapist is a narrative adventure / therapy simulator in the vein (get it) of What We Do in the Shadows, Young Frankenstein, My Dinner with Andr\u00e9, and Horrible Histories where you play as a reformed bloodsucker helping other vampires find inner peace.\nThis isn't your typical visual novel \u2014 featuring a fangtastic cast (such as Matthew Mercer, Sarah Grayson, and Cyrus Nemati), Vampire Therapist teaches real therapy concepts with a story that explores what it means to live, die, live again, and maybe even how to feel alive. Because even vampires deserve to love themselves.\nStep into the boots of Sam, a reformed Wild West gunslinger turned vampire therapist. After centuries of bloodshed, Sam teams up with a 3000-year-old blood-sucking mentor in a moody German nightclub, to guide fellow vampires through the twists and turns of their immortal existence \u2014 offering them a chance at self-acceptance in a world that feels ever more alien.\n\n\nFEATURES\n1. Real Therapy Concepts: You\u2019ll learn and apply real cognitive behavioral therapy concepts vetted by licensed therapists. By challenging client statements that contain \u201ccognitive distortions\u201d, you\u2019ll help vampires see where their thoughts don\u2019t match reality.\n2. A Comedic Look Through History: Meet emotionally damaged vampires from ancient Greece, Renaissance Italy, Tudor England, and the Bronze Age.\n3. An All-Star Voice Cast:  Featuring Matthew Mercer (Critical Role, Baldur's Gate 3), Francesca Meaux (Hades), Sarah Grayson (Gone Home, Hades II), Kylie Clark, and the game's creator, Cyrus Nemati (Hades, Pyre).\n4. Unique Setting: Vampire Therapist merges cozy self-introspection with a dark European goth vibe. In fact, the whole thing takes above a goth club in Germany filled with willing necks to bite.\n5. Minigames: Learn mindfulness meditation, safely and consensually bite sexy necks\n\nNOTE: The game deals with mature and challenging themes that are not for the faint of heart.",
