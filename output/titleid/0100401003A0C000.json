Instantly switch between them to dodge waves of bullets, reach secret areas, or surprise your enemies. Play solo or turn it up to 11 with a local co-op partner to give your enemies hell when you team up on one screen, or split up to grab as much loot as possible.\n\nUnlock and power up a variety of weapons like the Flak Shotgun - an overpowered beast that blasts ships to atoms at point blank range or the burning wall of space death streaming from the flame-thrower like Plasma Torch. Master advanced techniques like the Drift Drive that lets you dodge bullets in a split second or even flip into Reverse Drive to hit enemies when they least expect it. \n\nFight through a richly detailed sci-fi adventure and unfold the secrets of the Dimension Drives, then climb the global leaderboards in four different difficulty modes ranging from Normal for a balanced challenge to Insane for whoever can take the pain. Still too easy?
