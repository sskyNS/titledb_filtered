	"description": "Shipped is an adorable party game where up to 8 players compete in sea skirmishes. Choose your favorite girl and navigate the sea. Your ship can\u2019t break, so first learn how to maneuver. With simple controls, it\u2019s easy to start but hard to master.\n\nTo win, you must push your opponents to crash on land or out of the screen. Or just shoot them. To do that, grab ammo crates. If you\u2019re out of cannonballs, use your cannon and blow air to push enemies or deflect incoming fire. Remember to keep up with the movement of the camera - if your ship goes off-screen, it will instantly explode!\n\nWith five different modes, you\u2019ll never get bored playing Shipped. If you\u2019re short on friends to play, you can always add AI-controlled players or try the challenging single-player arcade mode. \n\nFeatures: \n\n- Local multiplayer for 2-8 players.\n- Arcade single-player mode or AI-controlled players for solo play.\n- Five different game modes: Cruise, Chase, Race, Yincana, Sumo.\n- Fun and straightforward mechanics. \n- Lovely characters, colorful graphics, and a pleasant soundtrack. \n- Over 95% positive reviews from PC players!\n",
