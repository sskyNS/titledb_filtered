	"description": "In a bar, on the world's most remote island, a group of strangers share their stories. Step into their shoes and experience travel from distinct perspectives. Wanderlust Travel Stories is a book that you shape. If you\u2019re seeking something a little bit different it is for you\u2014and if you can read this, you have all you need to get started. \n\nFour long stories and five short ones, each written by its own team of authors. Every journey offers a unique playstyle as you experience travel through the eyes of distinct individuals. Like an idealistic student, a jaded reporter, or a man who\u2019s simply a terrible planner.\n\nInspired by true stories and set in real places. Travel to the mysterious statues of Rapa Nui, bustling streets of Bangkok, pristine expanses of the Antarctic, grasslands of the Serengeti, and more. Dive into tales created by passionate travelers and experienced reporters, see the world they saw throughout their journeys.\n\nYour choices shape the characters\u2019 mood. This, in turn, changes how you see the world. All emotions are valid: happiness or enthusiasm aren\u2019t everything, feeling sad or fatigued is perfectly natural.\n\nTasteful aesthetic, bespoke photography, and immersive soundscapes set the tone. Just enough to stir your own memories or feed the imagination.\n\nLike a peaceful afternoon with a cup of tea and a novel, it\u2019s a slow-paced and meditative experience. You don\u2019t have to rush or fight, you can take in every moment at your own pace. If this is what you seek, we introduce to you what we call Slow Gaming.",
