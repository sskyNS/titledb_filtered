As British and Canadian forces pinned down the Germans around Caen, General Bradley's U.S. First Army prepared for a massive breakout: Operation Cobra. The stage was set in the bocage country of Normandy and northwestern France, including places like Br\u00e9court, Saint-L\u00f4, and Carentan. After repeated delays due to bad weather, the operation began on July 25 with thousands of Allied bombers carpet-bombing German defenses.\n\nThe U.S. VII and VIII Corps spearheaded the advance, and the Germans, short on men and materiel, struggled to mount an effective defense. The main American tank, the highly maneuverable Sherman M4A2, leads the charge alongside infantry. The Germans counter with the formidable Tiger II, known for its powerful cannon and thick armor. The narrow streets of Br\u00e9court, the ruins of Saint-L\u00f4 and the fields of Carentan were the scene of fierce tank battles.\n\nOn July 26, the Americans secured the Le Mesnil-Herman crossroads and reached Coutances on the 27th. Despite resistance from German 88mm anti-aircraft guns and Tiger IIs, the Allied assault quickly broke through the defenses. Sherman tanks, working closely with infantry, smashed through the German lines, forcing the enemy to retreat across the Seine.\n\nOperation Cobra marks a turning point on the Normandy front, allowing the Allies to begin their advance to liberate the world. Now players must join the chaos, strategy, and courage of the battlefield alongside Sherman tanks and fight for the freedom of the world.",
