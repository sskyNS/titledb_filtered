	"description": "Jeremy's partner Leo disappears after a car crash. As Jeremy dives into Leo's past in order to find him, he can't quite shake the feeling that there's a lot more going on than a simple vehicle-related accident. Jeremy's not gonna just sit around and wait. The night is still young and there's a mystery to be solved!\n\nThis game is styled after old pre-2000s adventure games. This means bottomless pockets for any items you deem useful, dialog options and a story to click (or touch / button press) and puzzle your way through. This time around you even have thoughts in your inventory, allowing you stay focused on the taks ahead. Don't question it. Just throw your thoughts and items at any people you meet. Unlike in real life, talking to other humans isn't hard in this game! So why go outside when you can play this instead?\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u25cfOver 30 scenes (or 'rooms' if you will) to explore\n\u25cfOver 12 other characters to interact with\n\u25cfMaybe your boyfriend will tag along a bit later\n\u25cfVarious visual options aka retro modes\n\u25cfA weird story with mystery/supernatural elements\n\u25cfTwo endings\n\u25cfNo dead ends\n\u25cfSome additional stuff to do if you want to be extra nice",
