Every ten years, a chosen soul must descend into the darkness in the hope of ending the curse.\n\nA secret council now prepares the ritual once more, forging a magical six-sided die\u2014an artifact said to shape fate itself.

Choose wisely\u2026 luck does not always favor the bold.\n\nThe Council Has Spoken:\n\nThe fate of the realm now rests in the hands of the dice-wielding knight.\nWill you break the curse\u2026 or watch the kingdom fall into darkness?\n\nKey Features:\n\n10 unique, trap-filled dungeons\n\nFirst-person, turn-based combat\n\n50 hidden Red Coins to discover\n\nRare monsters with massive EXP and gold rewards\n\nRandom events with branching outcomes\n\nAtmospheric 3D pixel-art environments",
