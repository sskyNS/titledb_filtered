	"description": "Chessarama is a collection of original puzzle and strategy games inspired by Chess. It reimagines chess rules and tactics using many different themes. Each game has its own set of rules, visual theme and original handcrafted challenges for you to play!\n\nHere are all the original games you will find in Chessarama: (1) Farm Life; (2) Dragon Slayers; (3) Street Soccer; (4) Lady Ronin; (5) Last Stand; (6) Knight Supreme; (7) Pawn Mania; (8) Soccer Chess.\n\nTake a look at some of the Chessarama games:\n\nIn Dragon Slayer, you need to push your pawn to the end of a path in order to kill the mighty dragon. But it will not be that easy! The dragon attacks the board every time the pawn moves and every undefended piece will die.\n\nIn Lady Ronin, Chess meets Sokoban. You play with a Ronin (a chess queen) and you need to eliminate the other pieces in order to get close to the Shogun and kill it. Pieces move like in chess, but push each other like in sokoban.\n\nIn Soccer Chess you will play a soccer match using chess pieces. You will need to think a few moves ahead if you want to break through the adversary's defenses to score a goal.\n\nThis is just some examples about how Chess can be reinvented.
