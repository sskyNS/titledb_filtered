Get ready for fast paced arcade gameplay with unique game mechanics that will give you an unforgettable experience.\n\nStory\nIt all started at night, when the sky suddenly lit up with many meteors that strayed from their usual trajectory. However, these were not just meteors. As they approached the surface of the Earth, they opened up, turning into strange living structures known as \"Toilets\". These toilet-like creatures immediately began attacking towns and villages, causing chaos and destruction.\n\nHumanity was not ready for such an invasion. The speed and aggressiveness of \"Toilets\" terrified people.

Your mission is not only to stop the \"Toilets\" invasion, but also to uncover the mystery of the Holy Toilet. Only by defeating him will you be able to break the shackles of this sinister ideology and restore freedom to the infected people.
