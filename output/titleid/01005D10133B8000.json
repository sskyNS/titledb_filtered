	"description": "To get the King's Crown and save the realm Brave Lord has to face the ghostly apparition of Lord Grave and break through the deadly rooms of the Royal Palace fiercely protected by countless trap mechanisms.\n\nKiller Chambers is an action-platformer/memory-game hybrid. You must survive in small rooms filled with traps until one turn of the hourglass.\nBeware, even if you're hit only once you die! Can you hold out against an unforgiving bullet-hell in a narrow space?\n\nNothing is left to chance, every trap pattern is made to be challenging yet fun to solve but quick reflexes alone will not be enough to survive.\nArm yourself with masochistic persistence and good (muscle) memory, the King's Crown awaits you!\n\n- Fast-paced and tough action-platformer with puzzle and \"bullet-hell\" elements.\n- Over 40 rooms, each one with 3 levels of difficulty.\n- 5 floors with unique traps and bosses.\n- More than 500 finely tuned trap patterns.\n- A funny story told by dialogues in a visual novel style.\n- Many items to help +Brave Lord+ in his adventure.\n- 12 hats that grant you special powers, as long as they don't fall from your head!",
