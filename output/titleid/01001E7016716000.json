	"description": "Paying homage to classic skiing and winter sports action of the past, Horation Goes Snowboarding is an arcade-inspired experience that\u2019s straightforward and addictive, purely focused on thrilling gameplay without a story or complex mechanics to weigh it down! Start every run with a bunch of money and the urge to snowboard, then hire a board and head to the waiting chopper while avoiding traffic along the way. Once you\u2019re airlifted the top of a mountain, it\u2019s time to start your chaotic descent!\n\nCourses are randomly generated to keep things interesting every time you play, and obstacles get increasingly tricky as you progress! Move your board left and right as you plunge downhill, racking up points by going through slalom gates and adding to your score multiplier as long as you don\u2019t miss any. But watch out for the yeti! If you wipe out on the slopes, you\u2019ll have to pay hospital fees, and running out of money means game over. It\u2019s an endless cycle of snowy score attack fun, topped off with leaderboards to prove you\u2019re the raddest boarder on the mountains!\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Grab a snowboard and get through traffic to take a chopper to the mountains!\n\u2022 Slalom down randomly generated slopes with unpredictable obstacles.\n\u2022 Claim a cash bonus for reaching the finish line in one piece!\n\u2022 Avoid hospital fees to hold onto your money and keep boarding.\n\u2022 Share your high scores across online leaderboards!\n",
