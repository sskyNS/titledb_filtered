	"description": "The enemy mothership has been destroyed and is about to explode. Reinforcements are coming, but your battered ship's guns are overheated and almost useless. Thankfully, you also have bombs. Lots of bombs. Blast Rush LS is a fast-paced bullet hell shooter with an endless supply of screen-clearing weapons.\n\nIt's just you, your ship, and seemingly endless amounts of drones in ever more complex waves. But hey, you got all those bombs to use! Blast your way out and rush to victory!\n\n* A refreshing feature-packed take on shoot-em-ups that dares to ask: \"What if bomb, but way too much?\"\n* Three distinct fighters with nine different screen-clearing bombs to try (and blow through enemies on an industrial scale) and extra techniques like destructive sideswipes or the slow-mo power of Hyperdodge!\n* Take on over 40 intense levels with almost impossible amounts of drones in twisting, complex waves coming after your ship. \n* Prefer an even greater challenge? Have a go at the randomized Endurance or 2-minute styles.\n* More blasting fun awaits in the \u201cBlast Box,\u201d a host of four challenges where you\u2019ll beat the clock, fight enemies in the dark, wriggle through a dangerous maze, or launch a ship like it\u2019s a sporting event.\n* 16-bit-style graphics with a pulse-pounding chiptune soundtrack\n* Explore the Library to check out game development notes, concept pixel art, a music player when you\u2019re away from the action, and more!\n* The full original version of Blast Rush is included as part of the package!",
