	"intro": "A visual novel set in a surreal summer camp dystopia. Follow three teens as they become friends and prepare to fight the real, actual devil. ",
	"description": "Anyone can kill the devil; that\u2019s why they always make teens the vampire slayers, the magical girls. But some kids can\u2019t even get that right; and that\u2019s why meangirl Neptune, tomboy Jupiter, and shy shy Venus have to endure one more week of summer camp and each other, singing boring songs about jesus, doing busywork for adults, and hoping god\u2019s radio can\u2019t hear them.\n\nBefore they can leave the summer scouts, they\u2019ve got to spend twelve hours in the loneliest cabin in the woods and wait for the devil to come and live through the night--or not. You know.\n\nTwo will become closer, but what will happen to the one left out? ",
