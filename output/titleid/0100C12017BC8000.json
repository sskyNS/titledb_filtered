	"description": "It\u2019s a Wrap!\u00a0is a challenging 2D puzzle platformer set in 1980s Hollywood, where you play both the director and the star of action-packed, low-budget films.\n\nAll you wanted to do today was shoot a nice little popcorn movie, but everything is going wrong! As the director, you need to synchronize the actors and props that are messing up their timings. Then, as the movie\u2019s star, you need to remember your script and play out the scene\u2014without getting crushed by that giant boulder!\n\nFeatures\n\nDirector\u2019s Phase.\u00a0Grab your megaphone and hop into the director\u2019s chair to puzzle your way through the timing of props, actors, and special effects to make your scene work\u2014and keep your star in one piece.\n\nAction Phase.\u00a0When you think you\u2019ve got your scene set up correctly, roll the cameras and enjoy a variety of traditional 2D gameplay like platforming, car chases, and space battles where you control the movie star Johnny Rush in his most iconic roles.\n\nA hundred colorful ways to \u201cdie\u201d.\u00a0Every time you fail, poor Johnny\u2014who does not have a stunt double\u2014will suffer a hilarious demise inspired by classic cartoons and adventure games. But don\u2019t worry about long-lasting injuries, just rewind back to the beginning of the scene and try again!\n\nHeaping spoonfuls of nostalgia.\u00a0Each level is part of a movie with its own unique genre and look inspired by the biggest blockbusters of the 80s. See if you can spot all the references to your favorite fictional professors of archaeology, space wizards, and retired soldiers on the run from the law!",
