	"description": "Welcome to Ghost Kiosk, where the grill is hot, the coffee\u2019s warm, and something just isn\u2019t quite right. You\u2019ve landed the night shift at a lonely little food stand tucked away on a rainy corner\u2014and while the hours are quiet, the atmosphere is anything but.\n\nAs you whip up late-night snacks and serve the occasional drenched customer, strange things begin to creep into your routine. A flickering light here, a whisper over the radio there\u2026 and those customers? They seem to know a little too much about you.\n\nKeep the orders coming, keep your cool, and try not to look too long into the shadows. Behind every receipt and every soda pour, there\u2019s a story waiting to be told. Will you crack the mystery behind the kiosk\u2019s eerie past\u2014or become part of it?",
