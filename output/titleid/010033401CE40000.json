	"intro": "Block Buster Billy is a puzzle game where you move blocks with digits and basic math operations to form numbers and equations. When you complete an equation, it turns into a big block you can move out of the way to open the treasure chest.\n\nCombining these simple rules with carefully placed blocks leads to some very challenging puzzles.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Over 100 hand crafted levels\n* Turn based gameplay\n* Non-linear progress\n* Light math, but tricky level layouts\n* A goofy story about aliens visiting Billy's island\n\nThere are different paths you can take on each island, so you don't have to play the levels in some particular order. If you get stuck on one puzzle, you can go back to the island and select another level.\n\nLevels are linked. Solving a level gives you a piece for the level you entered from.\n\nFor every new game mechanics there are a couple easy levels that serve as tutorial.\n\nSome of the levels took me a full day to design, test and refine to perfection. I hope you'll have as much fun solving them as I did while making the game. \n",
