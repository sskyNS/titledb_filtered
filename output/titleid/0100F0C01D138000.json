	"intro": "Become a tattoo artist and manage your own parlor in the city of Tattuga Bay!",
	"description": "Tattuga Bay was once the center of the tattoo scene, but today, almost all parlors are closed. You take over the last remaining tattoo shop and turn it into a thriving business, while making friends or enemies with other local characters, from quirky customers and troubled tattoo artists to the city's most influential businessman, \"\"the Tycoon\"\". \n\nTHINK INK\n\nGo all out on the interior design of your parlor. Get new furniture and make your rooms look fresh to attract more customers. Talk to them to find out what they really like and what topics to avoid. Only then can you offer them a tattoo design they cannot refuse.\n\nYou'll need a steady hand to get ink into skin without hurting your customers (too much) in the process. Beauty is pain, but the happier they are with your work, the bigger the tip.\n\nNIGHT AND DAY\n\nTime is money. You choose when to open and close your shop, deciding how to use your limited time and energy to face each day's new challenges.\n\nHone your skills and styles, hire new employees, and handle the day-to-day operations of a tattoo artist.\n\nTAILORED TO EACH CUSTOMER\n\nEveryone has their own unique interests. You'll need a variety of tattoo designs, decorations, and tattoo-related products like skincare, t-shirts, and posters. People might also want coffee, a cold drink, some snacks, and comfortable seating while waiting for their turn to get a tattoo.\n\nTo help you manage your ever-expanding customer base, you must assemble a competent team of specialists who can cover the different steps when working with a customer.\n\nA PERSONAL STORY\n\nYou create and customize your own character in Tattoo Tycoon and build personal relationships with those around you. Learn about their issues and help them earn your trust.\n\nWhile launching marketing campaigns to promote your art can help, personal connections and word-of-mouth are just as vital for making a name in the tattoo world. And only the most renowned artists can enter the most prestigious tattoo competition: Ink-Vasion! \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create your own character and experience a unique story.\n* Manage every aspect of being an aspiring tattoo artist, entrepreneur, and shop manager.\n* Choose from many tattoo parlors in a vibrant city and take it to the top, or change locations as often as you like. Each neighborhood offers its own perks and challenges!\n* Customize and specialize your parlor with advanced tattoo equipment, interactive features, and a wide array of decorations and furniture.\n* Unlock over 100 unique tattoo designs, attract new customers, cater to different target groups, and improve your tattooing skills.\n* Tattoo your clients, but be careful: Understanding the preferences of different target groups is essential for choosing the perfect tattoo design.\n* From tattoo artists to receptionists, hire a team for your tattoo parlor and make it truly your own.",
