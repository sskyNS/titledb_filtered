Advanced, more efficient and remarkably perceptive, unit M.A.R.A. begins to penetrate Cila's toughened exterior and possibly even heal her new owner's old wounds \u2013 if Cila can decipher the recurring nightmare the process brings.

A war unlike any before is brewing on the horizon, its players are silently being selected and one android's fate may spell the difference between peace, war, the blossoming of a new religion or a technological singularity beyond comprehension.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Journey through a cyberpunk setting of neon-lit corruption.\n\u2022 Explore nearly 100 unique backgrounds and CGs.\n\u2022 Meet 20+ characters with personal histories woven into the narrative.\n\u2022 Experience a vivid soundtrack composed by Andy Andi Han.\n\u2022 Make key choices that impact the story and lead to multiple endings.",
