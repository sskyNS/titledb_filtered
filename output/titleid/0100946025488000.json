	"description": "Take the Challenge\nDeivy made a pact with Randoom, he would be his toy and go through all of Randoom's challenges in exchange for having anything he wanted after it was over. Now Deivy has been turned into a chess piece and is trapped in Randoom's mansion, a dangerous place full of challenges.\n\nWhat is Trials of Randoom?\nTrials of Randoom is a precision platformer with puzzle elements, featuring Deivy and his terrifying situation in search of freedom and salvation.\n\n\nWho is Deivy?\nDeivy was once an ordinary human. Too common. He became a pawn to participate in Random's challenges, as he was so desperate that he would do absolutely anything to achieve his goal, even making a pact with a demon.\n\n\nThe Mighty Random\nRandom is what some call the crossroads demon, but this crossroads story is just a popular myth, as he can show himself anywhere. It appears when someone is in a completely hopeless situation. When a person is so hopeless and ready to accept anything, that's when he offers his deals. He makes fun of people in exchange for helping them with their problems.\n\n\n\nThe Mansion\nThe mansion, in which Deivy is imprisoned, is special. Deivy's movements are limited by the powers of the mansion, making every challenge even more difficult!\n\nThe challenges in the mansion are very diverse. Will Deivy make it through them all?!",
