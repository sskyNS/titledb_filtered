	"intro": "Turn the simplest shapes into something extraordinary.",
	"description": "A factory-building game about transforming primitive shapes into complex 3D objects. Start with the four basic forms \u2013 Sphere, Cube, Pyramid, and Cylinder \u2013 and combine them through production chains to create more advanced objects. Design efficient layouts, optimize your workflow, and balance time and resources to keep your factory running smoothly. Every decision matters: Build and expand your production chains. Manage efficiency and pacing through careful balancing. Unlock new possibilities as your factory grows. The goal is simple, but the path to mastery lies in how well you can turn the simplest shapes into something extraordinary.",
