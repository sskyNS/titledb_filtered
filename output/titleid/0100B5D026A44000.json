	"description": "Carnival Heroes is cross-platform online multiplayer board game for 2 to 4 players which includes 24 minigames which you play along the main game.\n\nThe game can be played in 3 game modes: Online (vs real human players, Local (with up to 4 players) or Solo (vs AI).\n\nGAMEPLAY\nYou take turns in an order determined by the biggest dice roll.\nOn your turn you roll a dice and you use (or not) an item you previously collected.\nThe goal in the game is to collect as many crowns as possible.\nCrowns are bought with gems.\u00a0 Gems you collect by walking onto the game board, by landing on chests or by winning in minigames.\nAt the start of the game you choose animal avatar which you will play as.\nEach of the 8 avatars comes with a special dice which you can play if you want (you either play the regular 1 to 6 dice or the character special dice).\n\nThe game has two main gameplay modes: FREE and FIXED.\n\nIn FIXED mode you walk along a fixed routers. But you still choose which direction to go on the intersections.\n\nIn FREE mode you draw your exact path on which you player will go. You have to make sure you make most of your path (i.e. it goes through many gems, mates and it lands on a board item.\n\nBOARD ITEMS\n\nGems. These are diamonds in 3 colors: red = 1 gem, green = 2 gems and blue = 3 gems.\nGems are used to purchase crows or  items from the store.\n\nCrowns. This is what you must be aiming to get. Crowns are bought with gems. In the beginning of the game 1 crown costs 10 gems..but as the game progresses they will become more and more expensive (15 or 20 gems).\n\nMates. Mates are special animal friends which will follow you onto the game board and will give you gems for each player you jump over (i.e. pass through its place).\u00a0\nEach mate you have, will give you additional big dice that you can roll instead of the regular 1 to 6 dice. Moreover, mates have their own small dice that they will roll with you and it will be added to your dice value.\n\nChests. These will give you random prize in form of items or gems. \nItems are inventory stuff which you can use throughout the game (dice addons, portals or many other special items).\n\nEvents. Shown as questionmarks on the board, events are immediate actions like teleportations, crown movement traffic light switchings and others.\n\nBattle. Landing on battle will force all players to bet a random amount of gems and play in a randomly chosen minigame. The winner takes it all\n\nHidden gifts. These are hidden fields (empty cells) which you don't see. If you land on a hidden gift, you will get a random prize or a bomb.\nPositive gifts are gems, mates or items.\nNegative gifts are gems taken from you or losing a mate.\n\nTraffic Lights, These switches are giving you 2 routes to pass: free one and a paid one.\u00a0\nPaid route costs X gems to pass. On each pass it increases its price with 1.\n\nCracked tiles. Some tiles get cracks once a player lands on them.\nWhen the crack gets big enough, the last player passing through it will pay small gems tax to repair the crack.\n\nStores. If you land on a store, you have the option to buy an item. Items usually cost 2-3-4-5 gems. Once all items are bought from the store, new ones will be automatically added.\n\nMINIGAMES\nThe game contains 24 fun minigames in which you will be tested by proving your speed, precision, memory, agility, strategy and luck. These small games are very different from one another and are played either in real time or played solo games vs AI\n\nGAME OVER\nOnce the turns finish, a prize crowns will be announced. There will be 3 crown prizes given for a different randomly chosen condition. \nCrown can be given for the best player in the fun minigames, or for the most traveled spaces player - or other bonuses. \nThe final winner is the one who has the most crowns. \nIf two players have same number of crowns - then their gems will play a role in deciding the final winner.\n\nGood luck hero!",
