	"description": "In this visual novel, a mystery will grip you.\n\nA danger you can't ignore, emotions that burn in the darkness.\n\nWhat begins as a simple investigation soon turns into a nightmare that's impossible to explain. Strange symbols appear on the walls, inhuman whispers fill the air, and the feeling of being watched from the shadows becomes unbearable. Ethan, Sophia, Mia, and Lucas are about to discover that some secrets should never be revealed.\n\nAs they search for answers, they not only face supernatural dangers, but are also drawn into a whirlwind of growing emotions and tensions.\n\nSophia and Ethan share a connection that grows with each moment of danger. Between silences loaded with meaning and a chemistry that's impossible to ignore, they find themselves caught in a game of glances and feelings that neither dares to confess.\n\nLucas and Mia are the clash of two opposing forces. Arguments, sarcasm and unexpected complicity force them to confront what they really feel, even when fear and mistrust threaten to tear them apart.\n\nBut in the darkness, something is lurking. And this time, running won't be enough.\n\nAre you ready to delve into the mystery?",
