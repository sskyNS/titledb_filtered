	"description": "Infernium is a game filled with brutal challenges to overcome. While playing the game you won\u2019t be able to kill or damage most of the enemies but at the same time running away without a second though is not the solution. While being chased you will need to think and reconsider your strategy and open hidden shortcuts while the world and it\u2019s lore will unfold around you in a non-linear way making each playthrough diferent. From the creator of the multi awarded indie game of the year MIND: Path to Thalamus.\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Accesibility Matters. When making Infernium accesibility features have been taken into consideration for physically disabled, deaf and colorblind gamers. \n\u2022 A brutal prison without bars, where the world is the real cell, full of enemies and traps that will make your path challenging.\n\u2022 Agony-inducing environments and challenges.\n\u2022 17 interconnected non-linear levels.\n\u2022 6 Easy to use, hard to master player skills to find and improve.\n\u2022 Diferent enemy kinds. Each one will require a diferent strategy/skill to overcome.\n\u2022 Persistent world. Every little change you make in Infernium will remain like that forever. \n\u2022 Robust, deep, Photomode included.\n\u2022 New Game + Mode.\n\u2022 Multiple Endings.",
