	"intro": "Embark on a perilous journey across a realm forsaken by the gods and devastated by an arcane cataclysm.",
	"description": "Accompanied by a hardy crew, you must trade, fight, and explore your way to success as the leader of a traveling company in Vagrus, an award-winning turn-based post-apocalyptic fantasy RPG.\n\nVagrus is a roleplaying game with a narrative focus, open-world exploration, and strong elements of strategy. The player takes the role of a vagrus - a caravan leader who strives to survive in a strange and perilous dark fantasy world by leading a traveling company on all kinds of ventures.\n\nA Dark Realm\n\nA vast realm is yours to explore, filled with unique locations, strange factions, and a colorful cast of characters. In order to punish the Empire for its sins, the Elder Gods unleashed their power a thousand years ago that resulted in the devastation of the realms. The continent is now a wasteland, riddled with arcane anomalies, swarming with twisted monsters, and haunted by roaming undead even after long centuries of rebuilding.\n\nBranching Narrative\n\nA large selection of stories make up the game\u2019s narrative in the form of events, encounters, and quests. The choices you make in these often affect your companions as well as the world around you. Pick your background from trader, mercenary, or explorer; work for factions, pursue rumors and trading opportunities; acquire wealth, gain fame, and discover hidden knowledge.\n\nTurn-based Combat\n\nEngage in turn-based, tactical combat that involves your companions and a large variety of enemies, both humanoid and monstrous. Use a wide range of character skills as well as your own leadership-related abilities to succeed. Positioning and support skills are of paramount importance in these challenging engagements.\n\nResource Management\n\nJourneys have to be planned and prepared for carefully, lest they end in disaster. Manage your supplies, morale, and your crew\u2019s vigor effectively to survive. Haul cargo and valuables across the wasteland or take it from others. Your crew of workers, fighters, scouts, and slaves have to be supervised closely to optimize their effectiveness.\n\nUnique Companions\n\nA wide variety of companions can work for you in versatile caravan roles, such as scoutmaster, guard captain, treasure hunter, or beast handler. Each companion comes with unique combat skills, background stories, and personal quest lines that can upgrade them further when you complete them.\n\nPowerful Factions\n\nAlly yourself with mighty factions that shape the Riven Realms with their influence on commerce, brutal wars, and their constant intrigue. From prosperous Trading Houses to criminal syndicates and religious organizations, these groups offer powerful rewards and boons to those loyal to their cause. But take heed - befriending a faction will more than likely antagonize some of the others.",
