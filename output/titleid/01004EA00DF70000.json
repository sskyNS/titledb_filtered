	"description": " The rule is quite simple: \"Get all the keys and get to the goal and clear\", but all 48 levels have special gimmicks designed specifically for multiplayer. At most levels, different gimmicks will appear as you move forward, and you will need to consult with your peers and think about new ways to cooperate. \n\n[Flexible Level]\n Each level of PICO PARK can be cleared when players get the key,unlock the door and all players reach it.But, every level requires cooperation to complete..\n\n[Battle Mode]\n Co-op play is the main work of this game, but let's compete with friends in BATTLE MODE once co-op play is completed.\n\n[Endless Mode]\n Even if you complete all 48 stages, you can play ENDLESS mode to aim at high score by collaborating with friends. By collaborating with friends, your score will grow faster.",
