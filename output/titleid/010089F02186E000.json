In order to counter this \"Lock and Key\" philosophy, Mosa Lina is aggressively random.\n\nThis does NOT mean that the game has proc-gen. Tools and Levels are handmade, they are just randomly selected and sometimes slightly modified!\n\nIt's literally impossible for me to check if all levels are beatable with all combinations of tools. This is what makes it so satisfying: There is no premeditated solution for you to follow. You're forced to get creative.\n\nThe game continually spits out randomised problems. It's up to YOU to solve them, because I've never seen them before.\n\nThere are no safeguards here. You might get the same item ten times in a row. You might beat the game without seeing it at all. Every playthrough contains only a fraction of the total levels. They're also selected randomly. Nobody knows what'll happen.\n\nIt's this reckless abandon of predictability that allows you to stop worrying about \"winning\" and frees you to enjoy the experimentation. Fun things happen more often if you don't force them.\n\nThe player, tiles, items and obstacles are all parsed through the same physics-engine. Everything interacts with everything else, allowing you to get really creative and expressive.Sure, all you do is collect fruits to open the portal, but HOW you do that is up to you entirely.\n\nSo far, every playtest has shown me that even the most straighforward design is powerless against the endless creativity of players. I sometimes discover new emergent behaviours myself, even after years of playing it\n\nBring a friend! Whether on the couch next to you or somewhere far away, Mosa Lina can now be enjoyed together! This opens up a lot of possibilities for crazy plays, hilarious fails and all-around creativity!\n\nUse the built-in Level Editor to make your own Level Packs, or check out the many Level Packs made by the community! This is the place for those who have mastered the base game and are looking for an extra challenge. Good Luck!\n\nThanks for checking out our game! Have a nice day :)",
