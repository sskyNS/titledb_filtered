	"description": "\u2018While We Wait Here\u2019 is a kitchen management game with dialogue choices and multiple endings.\n\nRun a small diner located near a mountain range, take orders from your customers, cook them good food and serve them refreshments.\n\nThe equilibrium of an ordinary working day is shattered when news of an impending catastrophe is broadcasted.\n\nNow looming over the characters in this game, is the catastrophic threat of the end of the world. At the diner, some of your customers seem to ignore it, blinded by their own problems they play the whole thing down or even refuse to believe it.\n\nOthers welcome it as punishment for what they have done in their life.\n\nAs you wait inside the diner, listen to their stories and offer them food for thought.\n\nWill you convince your customers to run for shelter, or will they stay at the diner, waiting for the end?\n",
