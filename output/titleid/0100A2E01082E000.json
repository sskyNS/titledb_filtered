	"description": "A branching narrative adventure set in the final 21 days of a dying city. Every decision you make will shape your surroundings, and the city\u2019s fate. However, the clock is ticking - and the city carries on, with or without you.\n\nSpeak to everyone from eerie politicians to chain-smoking child anarchists. Work as a trader, socialise, explore the town freely, and play a role in the city\u2019s hierarchy.\n\nCombining exquisite narrative depth and exploration with a curious setup - plus a dash of Lovecraft - A Place for the Unwilling is a rich narrative experience where player choices really do count, set in a Dickensian world of colour and Eldritch nightmares.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- The clock is ticking. Lose yourself in a strange new world that dies in 21 days.\n\n- Hyper branching narrative.Your every decision changes the environment, and the final outcome.\n\n- Living, breathing world. It\u2019s the ultimate branching story adventure, where the world carries on, with or without you.\n\n- Each walkthrough is unique. Over 100 narrative events based on everyday decisions and big ones shape a unique story.\n\n- Wide cast of characters and in-depth narrative. Covering themes of inequality, isolation, cosmic horror and more.\n\n- All story, no puzzles. No combat, mini-maps or quest markers. Story is everything.",
