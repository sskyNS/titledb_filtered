	"description": "Frogging Up is a punishing yet rewarding physics platformer about a small frog in a yellow raincoat who dreams of escaping his muddy village life. Guided only by determination (and a very questionable sense of balance), he begins an impossible climb through a surreal world of floating pipes, platforms, and mechanical ruins. Each jump is a step closer to the top and a better life.\n\n\u2022 Unique jump mechanic: The direction is controlled by the camera, while the strength depends on how long you hold the jump button. Mastering this precision system sets Frogging Up apart from other rage platformers.\n\u2022 Rage-platformer challenge: No checkpoints by default, one slip can erase everything, but victory feels truly earned.\n\u2022 Narrator commentary: A mysterious voice cheers, mocks, and reflects on your climb, turning failure into story.\n\u2022 A story of struggle and ambition: Climb from the swamps of a forgotten village toward the shimmering towers above, a metaphorical journey from poverty to success.\n\nWill you rage quit or rise from the mud and prove that even a small frog can reach the sky?",
