	"description": "A CLASSIC CONCEPT, TILTED\nUnder Defeat is a vertically scrolling shooter where you control a helicopter capable of moving in eight directions. It's a sleek, streamlined experience with just two buttons\u2014fire and bomb\u2014making it easy to pick up but hard to master. What sets the game apart is the tilt mechanic: as you turn, your shots tilt slightly left or right, allowing for strategic, angled attacks. You also have a small, satellite-like option unit that shoots independently. However, charging it requires you to release the fire button for a while, creating a tactical ebb and flow rarely seen in this all-out shoot 'em up genre.\n\nNEW ADDITIONS\nThere\u2019s a big difference between an arcade game and one you play at home, and Under Defeat has gotten several new additions since its arcade debut in 2005. The New Order Mode adapts the game to a modern 16:9 format, and the game has received both sharper textures and four selectable soundtracks. This includes a brand new one from original composer Shinji Hosoe, known for his work on Ridge Racer, Tekken, Street Fighter EX, SuperSweep among many others. Of course, for an authentic experience, you can still play Under Defeat in its original arcade format. How you enjoy this bombastic action fest is entirely up to you! \n\nA BLAST FROM THE PAST\nUnder Defeat is a true classic. The game first appeared in arcades, developed by G.rev and released in Japan almost two decades ago. Over the years, it has made its way to several platforms. Most notably, it was released on the Dreamcast in 2006\u2014long after official support for the console had ended. This 2024 edition is the ultimate version of the game, containing all previous content, meticulously ported by genre veterans. \n\nNEVERENDING WAR\nUnder Defeat doesn\u2019t throw you into an incomprehensible sci-fi universe that make no sense. Instead, it offers a (mostly) realistic depiction of a futuristic past. Specifically, you play as a helicopter pilot in a drawn-out war between the German-speaking Empire and the English-speaking Union, a conflict that has raged for over a decade. Both sides are exhausted, with heavy losses on each side, yet peace remains elusive. Will this destructive conflict ever end? You'll have to play to find out!",
