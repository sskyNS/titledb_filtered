	"description": "An active role-playing game released in Japan by T&E SOFT in 1985.\n\nFairyland is a peaceful kingdom inhabited by fairies.\nOne of the gems has been stolen by a human with evil intentions, awakening the demon Varalys, who is said to be the strongest in mythological legend.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Jim, a brave young man, and his objective is to restore peace to Fairyland by searching for the lost gem and defeating the demon Varalys.\n\nAction is the key to this game.\nPlayers switch between attack and defense modes as they fight monsters by slamming Jim into them.\n\nThis game is a pioneer of the Japanese PC fantasy RPGs of the 1980's. It is a monster title that reigned at the top of the popularity rankings in PC game magazines for a long time, with its diverse and beautifully composed fields, including plains, castles, churches, and labyrinths.\n\nIn addition, the newly released MSX version features a password save system and screen-switching scroll function, which are slightly different from the previously released PC-8801 version.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
