	"description": "In an age of myth and magic, ambitious wizards from around the world have assembled to undertake the perilous Trials of Legend in the Floating Lands. Many will try. Most will fail. Only those who have truly mastered the chaotic, shifting elemental forces of Arcana will become a Wizard of Legend!\n\nPrepare to face an all-new series of unpredictably perilous trials in Wizard of Legend 2\u2014the action-packed follow-up to the acclaimed dungeon-delving original, featuring vibrant new 3D visuals and fast-paced 4-player online co-op. Wield familiar and new Arcana, experiment with devious new spell combinations, and seek immortality as you return again and again (and again) to master ever-changing rogue-lite challenges.\n\nJourney Back to an Era of Legendary Trials\n\nPut your spellcraft skills to the test in the Floating Lands\u2014a shifting sorcerous gauntlet conjured forth by Hieronymus, Lanova\u2019s wizard supreme to find a wizard worthy of legend. Get to know the peculiar and powerful members of the wizarding council as they oversee, guide, or throw a twist into your trials.\n\nUnleash your Arcana\n\nHarness the power of familiar and new Arcana\u2014attacks that tame the land\u2019s magical chaotic forces into the form of fiery projectiles, magical melee strikes, swirling tempests, and more. Discover powers during your trial that change your Arcana (and your play) in unexpected ways. Mix, match, experiment, and master your favorite combinations\u2026until you find a new favorite on your next run.\n\nMaster the Elements\n\nCommand the raw aspects of fire, water, earth, lightning, air, and chaos. Upgrade your Arcana and equip fortune-changing Relics, adding new layers of possibility and potential. Focus on the raw damage of fire or the unbreakability of earth. Move quicker, sling Arcana faster, or seek balance as each trial demands.\n\nPersevere and prevail\n\nEach treacherous trial is unlike the last, and the odds are not in your favor. Learn from your predecessors\u2019 failures through a persistent rogue-lite progression system that grants more arcane options to your next initiate. Each trial takes you one step closer to becoming the Wizard of Legend!",
