	"intro": "The story of the evolution of the ancient fish \"Sacabambaspis\".",
	"description": "That pitiful fish-like creature that lived about 500 million years ago, Sacabambaspis. I\u2019m sure those creatures were living their lives to the fullest, that\u2019s what I believe. We, who live in the modern era, are also living our lives to the fullest. So in a way, we were all Sacabambaspis.\nThis work is a Sacabambaspis life adventure, depicting the fate and way of life of Sacabambaspis through our wild imaginations. Since it\u2019s all based on our imagination, it\u2019s all fiction.\n\n\nGame overview:\nAs a player, you become Sacabambaspis and live each day with your fellow Sacabambaspis, growing and evolving by swimming in the sea and eating plankton. As you progress through the story with your fellow Sacabambaspis, please witness what happens in the end. And please, etch their way of life into your eyes.\n\n\nFeature:\nOnline Multiplayer: You can play with up to 10 people at the same time. There are quick matches and friend matches, and you can join and leave at any time. In quick matches, Sacabambaspis from all over the world are living their lives to the fullest at their own pace. Friend matches allow you to easily play with specific friends with just one keyword. Of course, you can also play alone.\n\nStory: There is a simple story, but the way of life of Sacabambaspis is never simple.\n\nEvolution: By eating plankton and collecting evolution points, you can evolve and become stronger. Sacabambaspis becomes stronger. You might even grow horns.\n\nSurvival of the Fittest: Sacabambaspis preys on plankton, but there are also predators above Sacabambaspis. You probably have no choice but to run away. Probably.",
