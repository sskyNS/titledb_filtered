	"description": "Remnant: From the Ashes is a third-person survival action shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by monstrous creatures. \nAs one of the last remnants of humanity, you'll set out alone or alongside up to two other players to face down deadly enemies and \nretake what was lost. With over 100 varieties of enemies, 20 epic bosses, and endless possible combat scenarios, it\u2019s going to \ntake everything you\u2019ve got to make it out alive.\n\n\nA REMNANT OF MANKIND\nThe world has been thrown into chaos by an ancient evil from another dimension. Humanity is struggling to survive, but they possess the technology to open portals to other realms and alternate realities. They must travel through these portals to uncover the mystery of where the evil came from, scavenge resources to stay alive, and fight back to carve out a foothold for mankind to rebuild...\n\nENDLESS FANTASTIC REALMS AWAIT\nExplore dynamically-generated worlds that change each time you play through them, creating new maps, enemy encounters, quest opportunities, and in-world events. Each of the game\u2019s four unique worlds is filled with monstrous denizens and environments that will provide fresh challenges with each playthrough. Adapt and explore\u2026 or die trying.\n\nSCAVENGE. UPGRADE. SPECIALIZE.\nOvercome tough-as-nails enemies and epic bosses throughout hostile environments to earn experience, valuable loot and upgrade materials you can use to build a wicked arsenal of weapons, armor, and modifications to approach each encounter dozens of unique ways.\n\nSTRENGTH IN NUMBERS.\nInvading other worlds to seek an end to the Root is dangerous and survival is far from guaranteed. Team up with up to two other players to increase your chances of survival. Teamwork is necessary to make it through the game\u2019s toughest challenges\u2026 and unlock its greatest rewards. ",
