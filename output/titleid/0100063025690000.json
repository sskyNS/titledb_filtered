	"description": "Tropical puzzles, fruity explosions! In Hula Hula Wee, every level is a refreshing mix of logic and fun. Push coconuts across colorful maps, smash them into pineapple towers, and watch as they burst together into delicious Pi\u00f1a Coladas. The rules are simple, but the challenge keeps growing. Slide coconuts carefully, plan your moves, undo mistakes infinitely, and use bonfires to burn obstacles out of the way. To complete a stage, you\u2019ll need to destroy every pineapple tower and outsmart each tricky layout. The adventure spans 30 puzzles across three vibrant settings. Start on CoCo Island, where the basics are introduced with lighthearted challenges. Then head to Hula Beach, where new twists like craters force coconuts to stop mid-path. Finally, climb the Fire Tower, the toughest destination, where bonfires add a fiery layer of strategy to your quest. With its tropical theme, playful mechanics, and clever progression, Hula Hula Wee is the perfect puzzle getaway for anyone who loves a mix of brains and beach vibes.",
