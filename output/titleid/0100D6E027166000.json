	"description": "ELEVRAL is a first-person, fluid movement archery game set in a serene yet unforgiving world suspended in motion.\n\nDash, vault, and chain momentum as you race through beautifully crafted levels, fending off hostile drones and adaptive AI determined to knock you off course. Armed only with your bow and your mastery of movement, every run becomes a high-stakes dance of speed, precision, and control.\n\nELEVRAL rewards skillful play with a deep, multi-layered scoring system. Finish levels faster to climb the leaderboard, land daring long-distance shots for bonus points, and balance risk versus reward as enemies actively disrupt your flow. Ignore combat entirely and you\u2019ll pay the price; hesitation is just as dangerous as a missed step.\n\nWhether you\u2019re chasing perfect runs, experimenting with new routes, or pushing for score supremacy, ELEVRAL is built for players who crave momentum, mastery, and replayability.",
