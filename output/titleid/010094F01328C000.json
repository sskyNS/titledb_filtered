	"description": "The game won't let you exit the castle, no matter how you try. Technically you can win, but there is no end.\n\nARTEFACTS AND CURSES\n\nOpal VS Blindness - you forget the map and don't see any new rooms, flares become useless\nPearl VS Forgetfulness - you don't remember where have you been before\nRuby VS Lethargy - monsters get the first turn to attack\nDiamond VS Weakness - you lose 1 strength point every 20 turns\nEmerald VS Bad luck - your minimal attack power drop to 1 instead of 50% of strength value\nBlue Fire VS Bookstuck - book sticks to your hands and you can't attack anyone in this state\nSign VS everything except Bookstuck\n\nSPELLS\n\nWeb prevents the monster from attacking and lasts 0-3 turns. Costs 1 point of intelligence.\nFireball is obvious enough. Costs 2 points of intelligence.\nIQ instantly kills your opponent if its intelligence is less than yours. Otherwise, you lose. This spell doesn't spend anything.",
