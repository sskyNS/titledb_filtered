	"description": "JOLT is a fast paced, racing party game. The game at its core is a competitive platformer that\u2019s all about maintaining momentum with skillful navigation. The players compete to be the last robot standing. Using a charged burst of speed called the JOLT, and an array of different objects in the environment; your goal is to outperform or outright sabotage the other racers. Eliminated players are down but not out through the use of the VOID, a random Sabotage Power-Up that allows players to initiate revenge and change the outcome of the race!\n\nKey Features:\n\u2022 JOLT \u2013 A charged burst of speed that can effect certain objects\n\u2022 VOID \u2013 Sabotage Power-Ups from post-elimination\n\u2022 Local Multiplayer racing, up to FOUR players\n\u2022 Chaotic, fast paced rounds\n\u2022 Skill and Timing based gameplay\n\u2022 Multiple Tracks\n\u2022 Multiple Game Modes\n\u2022 Create your own Robot\n\nThe JOLT is a player's primary utility to winning the race. It has 3 stages of charge, each one taking longer to store but each allowing you to shoot considerably further. If the player can time its use correctly; they can use it just before a curve to shoot up a wall or JOLT through an obstacle. Many short cuts in the levels are JOLT dependent.\n\nOnce eliminated, a player has the opportunity to execute the VOID. After punching in the correct sequence, the VOID player is gifted a random Power-Up to inflict mass-disruption to the existing racers.\n\nThe game features multiple Game Modes; Racer is the standard and most game modes are based off this, such as Light Mode (where the level is dark and the leading player has a light attached to them).",
