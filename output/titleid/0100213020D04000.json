	"description": "Battle your way through a biopunk and Japanese mythology-inspired landscape filled with over-the-top, hip hop-infused 2D action. A single hit means death, but use your time-bending skills to take down your oppressors and you might yet save your dying nation.\n\n***\n\nBecome a harbinger of vengeance\n\nEngage in up-close-and-personal combat against bizarre genetically mutated enemies. Attack, parry and bend time to your will to make it out clean on the other side. Fail and gain the wisdom needed to refine your strategy.\n\n***\n\nA mind-bending take on Japanese mythology\n\nTake on the role of Takeru, a lone assassin tasked with raiding a surreal superpower empowered by biotechnology. Join in her struggle to balance the morality of extreme violence against the defence of her own people, in a story inspired by real-life Japanese mythology.\n\n***\n\nImmerse yourself in neon-drenched hip hop\n\nLet the intense hip hop soundscape and neon-soaked visuals assault your senses until they are raw. Every moment is punctuated with a visceral soundtrack from Japanese developer and hip hop group, DON YASA CREW.",
