	"description": "The Earnest Evans Collection is a collection of three classic games from the famed developers at Wolf Team (who would go on to create the famed Tales of RPG series): Earnest Evans, El Viento, and Annet Returns.\n\n\nEarnest Evans:\nPresident Calvin Coolidge has hired famed adventurer Earnest Evans to find and locate an ancient grimoire - The Necronomicon. Unbeknownst to Earnest Evans, someone else has their eyes on it: Al Capone! Al Capone hopes to use the book to resurrect the Dark Lord Hastur and control Europe unless Earnest and a young priestess named Annet can stop him!\n\nEl Viento:\nSeveral years after the events of Earnest Evans, Al Capone and a sorceress named Restiana are continuing a plot to revive the Dark Lord Hastur. It has been learned that Annet descended from Hastur's bloodline, and her blood alone can resurrect him. With assistance from Earnest Evans, Annet embarks on a journey to stop Al Capone's plans.\n\nAnnet Returns:\nThe exciting conclusion to this trilogy of games. Annet travels across Europe on a quest to protect the world from certain destruction at the hands of Siegfried Munchausen and the evil NeXesis Party.\n\nThis collection features:\n\nIncredible animated cutscenes in Earnest Evans and Annet Returns from the masterminds at MADHOUSE (Trigun, Cardcaptor Sakura, and more).\n\nMasterful soundtrack from acclaimed video game composer Motoi Sakuraba (Star Ocean, Tales of Phantasia, Mario Golf, Valkyrie Profile, and more).\n\nIncludes both the CD and cartridge versions of Earnest Evans (both of which had different stories).\n\nRewind any time - with the simple press of a button, you can undo any mistakes you make in gameplay.\n\nSave anywhere - you can save your progress at any moment from the in-game menu.",
