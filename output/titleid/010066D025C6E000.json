	"description": "Embark on a heartfelt journey as Owlen, a small owl soaring through mystical worlds filled with wonder and secrets. Guided by the voices of ancient spirits, you must restore balance by flying through magical circles, bringing plants, trees, and wildlife back to life.\nWhile exploring, you\u2019ll uncover hidden memory shards scattered across the lands. These shards hold the forgotten past and reveal Owlen\u2019s true mission. Collect enough of them to progress into new worlds, each with its own theme, atmosphere, and story.\nAt the beginning of each level, you are introduced to the world\u2019s history and setting. As you fly, spirits may call to you, offering guidance, requests, or glimpses of their memories. Your journey is one of freedom, discovery, and restoration \u2014 as you seek to heal the lands and uncover the ancient truth.",
