	"description": "Developed by Manfred Trenz (creator of the Turrican series) and published by German software powerhouse Rainbow Arts\u00ae, this game was originally released in 1995. Originally slated to come to the West as Targa, the game ultimately ended up as a Japan-only title, with only 10,000 copies printed, making it one of the most sought-after collectibles in retro gaming.\n\nYou are the Rendering Ranger known as Double R, a special forces soldier who must defend the Earth from a devastating alien invasion. Through nine levels of action platforming as well as blisteringly fast horizontal shooter stages, Rendering Ranger: R2  is one of the greatest technological showcases ever seen in the 16-bit era!\n\nFEATURES:\n\u2022 Faithful recreation of Rendering Ranger: R\u00b2 and its unreleased PAL version Targa with rewind and save features, powered by Limited Run Games Carbon Engine\n\n\u2022  Gut-wrenching side-scrolling action with sprawling stage design and cinematic presentation\n\n\u2022  Mind-blowingly fast horizontal shooting stages unlike any seen before on the hardware of its day\n\n\u2022 Upgradable weapons, tons of enemies, dynamic on-scene mayhem at nearly every turn\n\n\u2022  Gigantic bosses in sprites converted from pre-rendered 3D models\n\n\u2022 Timeless 16-bit action at its best from legendary game creator Manfred Trenz",
