	"description": "\"Dinosaur\" is a role-playing game released in 1990 in Japan, featuring a rare 3D perspective for Nihon Falcom. With its dark and serious storyline, unique world-building\u2014including spell names like \"I Witness the Death-Dancing Maiden\"\u2014the game captivates players with its distinct atmosphere. But its gameplay mechanics are just as noteworthy.\n\nOne of the defining features of this game is the use of \"Techniques,\" which consume TP (Technical Points) to activate various special abilities. These abilities, including sword skills, magic, and songs, are learned through experience in their respective fields. The more they are used, the more they improve\u2014making for a highly immersive and realistic progression system. Additionally, the game includes a \"Technique Transmission\" event, allowing party members to share skills with each other. How players refine these skills and incorporate them into their adventure is entirely up to their strategy.\n\nRather than relying on unfair tricks, the game offers carefully designed maps tailored to each scene, creating a serious and immersive RPG experience. For those who enjoy deep, well-structured RPGs, this is a highly recommended title.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
