	"description": "A true metroidvania gore-fest\nYou play as a lone warrior on a quest to cross a Wasteland riddled with scoundrels and creeps who you'll have to go through - literally - in order to survive.\n\nRun, crawl, jump, hang, and, for the very first time in a Metroidvania (don\u2019t research this), bike your way through the world! Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the height of human-powered transport technology: the all-terrain Bike!\nYour trusty BMX is one touch of a button away at any time. Move around the map faster, access new areas, launch it at enemies, and perform sick bike tricks to gain bonuses.\n\nHack and slash your enemies with the obligatory machete or shoot them with the Kid\u2019s choc-full-of-mayhem Turbo Glove\u2122. Turbo Blast, Electric Shocks, circular saws\u2026 use the array of weapons at your disposal to slash, rip apart, or explode enemies into hysterical and over-the-top splashes of gore!\n\nA BMX-powered pixel-art Metroidvania gore-fest based on the film Turbo Kid.\nOur story begins immediately after the movie ends. On your journey, you will meet weirdos and oddballs, some friends, some foes, and some in-between, who will offer advice, quests, fights, and jokes (lots of jokes) in a heartfelt and hysterical story created in collaboration with the filmmakers behind the movie.\n\nExplore the different zones and defeat bosses in the order you see fit, make choices that will affect the course of the story, allowing for multiple playthroughs with different paths and outcomes.\n\nIf you don\u2019t care about the story and you\u2019re only in it for the gameplay (speedrun afficionados, we\u2019re looking at you), all the dialogue is skippable.\nMany cutscenes can simply be ignored if you don't wish to interact with them.\n",
