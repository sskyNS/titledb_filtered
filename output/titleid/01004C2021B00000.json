In the north, the ancient dragon Ramol awakened, leading chaotic legions southward, whilst Berend Forest grew increasingly poisoned by the Great King Slime's toxins. Each kingdom and city regarded one another with suspicion, waging conflicts over timber harvesting rights, plunging the entire continent into turmoil. Amidst this desperate situation, Ian Randolph, the ambitious young mayor of the free city of Anor, mustered his armies with grand designs, whilst Vampire Duke Carsus broke his 300-year silence to weave new conspiracies.\n\nIn this desperate crisis, the Crusade was formed, and remarkable heroes gathered. Elan, hero of the Crusian War, returned from retirement, whilst Tieris, the Demon Lord's daughter, set aside succession disputes to save the world. Eline, an elf who had lived 300 years; Vanphon, who rose from assassin to nobleman; Sespides, who became a vampire from near-death and began anew, along with the loyal knight commander who became a vampire trying to save her. The mysterious dancer Lina, who turned to vigilante work after completing her revenge; the innocent girl Raphe, who joined to earn magic school tuition fees. Hundreds of brave heroes, each with their own dramatic tales, united beneath one banner.\n\nNow begins the grand adventure of these distinctive Dragon Knights. An unprecedented alliance has formed, bringing together vampires and elves, humans and demons. They must overcome their painful pasts to become true companions, purifying corrupted forests, resolving conflicts, and standing against the forces of chaos. When the assassin's cold precision combines with the gladiator's indomitable spirit, the mage's wisdom with the dancer's elegant swordplay, what miracles might unfold? Can these heroes, bound by diverse abilities and deep friendship, restore peace to the continent of Lorain? The curtain rises now on this grand epic tale woven by heroes of unprecedented diversity and charm.",
