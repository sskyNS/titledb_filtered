With support for a local multiplayer mode, maybe the two of you together have just what it takes to beat the invading aliens once and for all and secure the top spot! You know you want too.\n\nFeatures: \n\u2022  30 different Challenges to complete\n\u2022  3 modes in the form of Classic Mode, Time Attack & Hardcore\n\u2022  2 player multiplayer\n\u2022  Various weapon types\n\u2022  Online leaderboards\n\u2022  Voice over narration by Barry Dunne",
