	"description": "Centipede Gun is a creature-building roguelite inspired by games like SNKRX and FLERP, where you create unusual beings by combining different shapes, modules, and... weapons!?\nTry out insane combinations and try to break the game with the craziest creations! Each combination offers new possibilities to defeat enemies in increasingly challenging battles. After each round, use the money you earn to buy different units in the store and further strengthen your centipede of destruction. But be careful \u2014 as you evolve, enemies also become stronger, testing the limits of your creativity and strategy.\n\nAssemble strange and powerful centipedes whose weapons automatically attack when enemies approach. Use special modules to add extra effects to your attacks and combine modules of the same type to evolve them, unlocking secret abilities as you reach new levels of power. Survive if you can and find out how far your centipede can go!",
