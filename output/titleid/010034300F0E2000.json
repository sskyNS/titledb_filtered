	"description": "Dungeon of the Endless is the award-winning Rogue-Like Dungeon-Defense game, in which you and your team of heroes must protect the generator of your crashed ship while exploring an ever-expanding dungeon, all while facing waves of monsters and special events as you try to find your way out...\n\nWHAT\u2019S BEHIND THE DOOR?\n\nA few hundred condemned criminals were being shipped to the Auriga system on board the prison hulk \u201cSuccess\u201d. While this was presented as a chance to earn back their place in society by working hard for the common good, they understood that in fact they would be slave labour, sent to colonize an unexplored planet. All they knew about Auriga Prime was what the probes told them: it had water, temperate zones, plant life, and plenty of metals in the crust.\n\nIn fact, the planet Auriga once hosted a major settlement of the galaxy-travelling ancestors known as the Endless. In addition, the planet was still orbited by a functioning (and well cloaked) defensive system, which sprang eagerly to life upon the arrival of the Success. Within a few minutes, the ship was nothing but a few large chunks of metal falling toward the planet.\n\nLuckily, every set of holding cells also functioned as an escape pod, so the ship let itself disintegrate and the surviving prisoners fell bruised but (temporarily) alive and (momentarily) safe to the planet below. Safe, that is, until they realized that they had crashed through some sort of Endless facility, all the way down to a sub-basement so deep and ancient it might as well be called a dungeon\u2026\n\nGather A Team\n\u2022 Form a team of heroes, each with their own strengths (and psychoses)\n\u2022 Equip them, deploy them, and earn powerful abilities\n\u2022 Manage the balance between ex-prison inmates and guards\n\nBuild Your Defenses\n\u2022 Use the Dust you gather to power the rooms\n\u2022 Use scarce resources to help your team survive\n\u2022 Build minor and major modules to hold off waves of monsters\n\u2022 Decode Endless ruins to discover life-saving technologies\n\nOpen the Door\n\u2022 Each door is a danger; prepare yourself and your team for anything\n\u2022 Explore and discover an infinity of levels and layouts\n\u2022 Carry your crystal through waves of monsters to the exit of each level\n\u2022 Fight your way to the surface to discover the truth about Auriga\n\nThe game also includes the following content:\n\u2022Deep Freeze\n\u2022Death Gamble\n\u2022Rescue Team\n\u2022Organic Matters",
