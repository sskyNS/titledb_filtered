	"intro": "You were desperate for money and accepted a shady job at a doll factory. What seemed like an easy way to make a quick buck turned out to be something much more sinister.",
	"description": "INSPECT ANOMALOUS DOLLS\nCarefully inspect each doll for strange defects or eerie behavior. Spot every anomaly, from subtle flaws to unsettling movements, and ensure that only the \u2018safe\u2019 dolls make it through.\n\nCREEPY WITHOUT SCREAMERS\nNot in the mood to be chased and screamed at by monsters? Tired of jumpscares and endless fights for survival? Dollmare is just for you.\nIt\u2019s still a horror game - you'll get scared, feel uneasy and constantly sense that something is watching you. There's no telling what might happen\u2026 but something definitely will. \n\nUNIQUE PLAYTHROUGHS\nEvery playthrough is slightly different. Many events in the game are not scripted, meaning that what you encounter is shaped by the moment.\nNo two players will share the exact same experience - your journey is distinctly your own. Explore and uncover the factory\u2019s secrets, where each moment keeps you from guessing what will happen next.\n\nWhat can you do on your shift?\n\u25aa Inspect the dolls for irregularities,\n\u25aa Explore the dark corners of the factory,\n\u25aa Maintain production equipment,\n\u25aa Follow strange protocols (just do - for your own safety),\n\u25aa Uncover the mystery behind the dolls and the factory,\n\u25aa Try not to lose your sanity\u2026 and your life.",
