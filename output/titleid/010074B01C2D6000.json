	"description": "Slap your way to the top of high society! Grace and glamour give way to open-handed duels across five games of aristocratic absurdity - Rose & Camellia 1, 2, 3, & 4, plus Rose & Camellia vs. La-Mulana - in which you'll slap, dodge, feint, and counter your way through a series of one-on-one smackdowns. \n\nAs an over-the-top inheritance dispute evolves into increasingly outlandish scenarios, you'll use Joy-Con\u2122 motion controls or touch-screen swipes to knock some respect into 24 ridiculous adversaries - or a friend in 2-player versus mode - complemented by full English and Japanese voiceovers, beautiful HD character art, and an anime-style intro. Give the upper crust a richly deserved smack in Rose & Camellia Collection!\n\nKey Features:\n-Five games in one: Rose & Camellia, Rose & Camellia 2, Rose & Camellia vs. La-Mulana, and - available for the first time ever - Rose & Camellia 3 and Rose & Camellia 4\n-Make your mark on high society in a story of aristocratic absurdity!\n-Reflex-based one-on-one action: slap, dodge, feint, and counter your way to victory!\n-Two control methods: motion-based Joy-Con\u2122 controls or touch-screen swipes!\n-More than 30 characters, all with English or Japanese voiceovers!\n-Two-player local versus mode! Give your friends the ultimate smackdown!\n-Gorgeous anime-style intro and vocal theme songs!",
