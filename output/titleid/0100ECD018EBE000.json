	"intro": "Join Mario on an epic paper-adventure to collect the Crystal Stars before the X-Nauts do!",
	"description": "The nefarious X-Nauts are after the treasure behind the Thousand-Year Door! With a map from Princess Peach, and the help of a few locals, Mario journeys through a colorful world made of paper to find them first. To prevail in this quest, you\u2019ll have to level up Mario and his friends, master timing-based attacks and badges to impress the audience on the stage of combat, and make use of all the abilities that come with being cursed\u2014er, conveniently made of paper\u2014like folding into a plane to cross big gaps or turning sideways to slip through narrow openings.\n\nLeaf through a storybook world with charming characters in every fold\n\nSurprises abound in this deep and engaging tale, where everyone\u2019s got something to say and it\u2019s often not what you\u2019d expect. Mario will meet all kinds of interesting folks on his journey, like the upbeat and studious Goombella and the shy but determined Koops. Some of these characters will need your help with their own quests, or even join your party. Others, like Peach and Bowser, have stories of their own that you\u2019ll play between Mario\u2019s chapters! \n\nA classic turns the page, bringing fresh visuals and updated features\n\nTwenty years after the original game on the Nintendo GameCube\u2122 system, this version for the Nintendo Switch\u2122 system has revamped graphics, an updated soundtrack, and gameplay additions like updated quick-travel pipes and a Partner Ring to swap characters in a jiffy. There are some additional improvements too\u2014visit the Battle Master if you need help with combat, access a hint system if you\u2019re stuck, equip the Nostalgic Tunes badge to play using the original soundtrack, and more!",
