	"description": "You just became the editor for a newspaper in a troublesome country. First, you have to make a choice. Will you support the government or will you go against it? Supporting the government can result in bankruptcy since there are a lot of newspapers doing just that already. Or you can take a stand against it and confront a president with questionable integrity, who is rushing towards dictatorship, without drawing too much attention.\nBe an editor to a newspaper\n        Decide on what news - lines - headline go through, assign it to one of your journalists. Manage your employees; or get new ones.\nDesign your paper' pages with the news you choose to publish, pick a commercial to print.\nOrganize paper route; decide where and how your newspaper will be distributed\nGo home and take care of your family, manage economics.\nReach for the different endings, depending on your management.\n\n",
