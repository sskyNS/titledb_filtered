	"description": "Tcheco in the Castle of Lucio is an 8-bit, 2D platformer. It\u2019s a challenging, non stop action experience that incentivizes quick thinking, platforming precision and memorization. \nLike older 8-bit games, it\u2019s a game that\u2019s meant to be replayed over and over again until mastered.\nQuick reactions and timing are necessary for success in the game. Levels \u2013 which are in the form of rooms \u2013 are short and require you to quickly scan to find a way to get to the next room, which is either a doorway that requires a key found within that room or a black hole\nVisually and from an auditory standpoint, everything about the game is designed to look and feel like an old school 8-bit game. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n+2D platform game, perfect for classic Famicom\u2122/NES\u2122 game fans!\n+Graphics and sounds inspired by 8-bit aesthetics.\n+2 game modes, \"Classic\" and the brand new \"Try harder\".\n+65 rooms of progressive difficulty.\n+Easy to learn, simple gameplay.\n",
