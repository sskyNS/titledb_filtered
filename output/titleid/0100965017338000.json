	"description": "Gather your friends, pick a board, and have a Mario party. Choose your character, roll some dice, and compete in an assortment of minigames to see who can get the most stars. From running through merry-go-rounds to motion-control* minigolf, there are seven boards and over 110 minigames to play!\n\nGo with the flow in Goomba Lagoon, search the mall for stars in Rainbow Galleria, or revisit the classics of Western Land and Mario\u2019s Rainbow Castle. With 22 playable characters, including newcomers Pauline and Ninji, Pro Rules for more serious competition, and a local single player mode, there\u2019s something for every kind of partygoer!\n\nTake the fun online in Koopathlon and Bowser Kaboom Squad\n\nRace across the party board in Koopathlon, a series-first 20-player online** competition to see who can rack up the highest scores in minigames like the fast-paced Lane Change. The higher your score in each round, the faster you\u2019ll get to the goal. If cooperative play is more your style, take on an Impostor Bowser in the 8-player online Bowser Kaboom Squad mode. Both online modes have worldwide rankings so you can see how you measure up against the best. You can also play the standard Mario Party mode with friends***,  family***, and others online!\n\nGet moving in Rhythm Kitchen, Toad\u2019s Item Factory, and Paratroopa Flight School\n\nMotion-control games are back! Cook to the beat in the Rhythm Kitchen cooking show, help Toads piece together party items in Toad\u2019s Item Factory, and soar through the sky in Paratroopa Flight School. There are also motion-control minigames in the standard Mario Party mode that you can toggle on or off.     \n\n",
