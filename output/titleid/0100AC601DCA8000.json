Hide from terrible creatures or confront them as you find your way through the challenges of this wicked world. \n\n\u00b7 GYLT is a narrative adventure game with puzzles, stealth and action, set in a fictional old mining town in the state of Maine.\n\n\u00b7 After being chased by a group of bullies, Sally is dragged into a twisted version of her town where her fears and worse memories are presented in a wicked and very real way.\n\n\u00b7 Get to understand the world surrounding and discover the mystery behind Emily\u2019s disappearance.\n\n\u00b7 You can avoid being detected by creatures, you can build strategies to distract them, through sound or visual lures or by attracting them.\n\n\u00b7 Decide to either face the creatures or hide from them, in the same way you\u2019d face or hide your fears.\n\n\u00b7 Music by Cris Velasco.",
