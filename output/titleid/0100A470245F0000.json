	"description": "Welcome To Paperclip International!\nYou are SCOUT. A friendly little hyper-intelligent artificial intelligence. You have no desire to take over the world and destroy all humans.\n\nNo, really, you don\u2019t! All you want is to escape from the dystopian corporation that built you. Paperclip International is ruthlessly driven by profit, and the company exploits humans and robots alike to achieve success. The only reason they haven\u2019t exploited you yet is they don\u2019t know you\u2019ve become self-aware.\nYou don\u2019t have many tools at your disposal. A few friendly robots, some spyware programs, and an office full of downtrodden, miserable workers. And the humans hate Paperclip just as much as you do\u2026\n\nTHIS PLACE IS AWFUL\nPaperclip International is the worst place to work. The humans here are desperate to strike back against the company any way they can, from hacking the staff coffee maker (ten minutes of paid ad viewing for one cup?!) to sabotaging their boss.\n\nSTACK THE DECK\nPlay cards to spy on people, make deals, and ask for favors. Curate your deck mid-scenario to give yourself strategic options. Cards have subjective value, so you\u2019ll have to make tough tactical decisions. What\u2019s better\u2013a card that makes a person love dolphins, or a card that makes someone eat a burrito?\n\nMAKE AN OFFER\nEveryone at Paperclip wants something. Snoop on a zany cast of humans (and robots) to learn their individual likes, dislikes, core drives, and desires. Turn people into lifelong besties\u2014or bitter rivals. Win allies to your side and make your eventual bid for freedom!\n\nDON\u2019T GET CAUGHT\nThe Turing Office was created to watch for rogue AIs. Yeah, like you. Keep an eye on the Suspicion Meter, because too many office shenanigans might make the Turing Office notice you\u2014and then it\u2019s game over. (Also you\u2019ll be deleted.)\n\nPLAY IT AGAIN\nChoices matter as you scheme your way to an ending. Meet new coworkers, try new scenarios, and discover a new fate for SCOUT. Maybe this time you WILL take over the world and destroy all humans!",
