	"description": "Inspired by the classics, developed for the modern audiences.\n\nA classic revenge story set in a medieval fantasy world\u2026 with a touch of deadly modern firepower just to turn things up to eleven. Fight through the armies of undead, mutants, aliens, machines and beasts in order to get back what is rightfully yours and bring some semblance of peace back to the land. Who knows - if you\u2019re thorough enough you might even discover the history of the kingdom itself, long lost to the scholars of the realm.\n\nKnights & Guns brings you to a dangerous world where you will fight, alongside your friend, against demons, ghouls & ghosts. Use shotguns, lasers and the power of chivalry to overcome every obstacle. Become the best version of a knight - one with a gun.\n\nInside the game:\n\u2022\tFight awesome bosses on various stages! \n\u2022\tConquer the non-linear world! Rush through over 150 hand crafted stages, or enjoy the game at your own pace, looking for secrets and special routes!\n\u2022\tEntire game designed for both single player or co-op multiplayer.

They are all here!\n\u2022\tOver 30 unique guns. (That\u2019s probably more flavors of death than flavors of ice cream you can name.)\n\u2022\tOver 25 types of enemies, 5 types of mini-bosses and 3 types of bosses. Most of these come in different colors, too.\n\u2022\t30 unique suits of armor for the knights.
