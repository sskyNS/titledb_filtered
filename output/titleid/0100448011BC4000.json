	"description": "Some games, just like food, are way more enjoyable when shared with someone else. So get 1 yourself, add 1 partner, mix it well with flying food and a pinch of challenge powder, and there you have it \u2013 Let\u2019s Cook Together, a bonding couch co-op experience for 2 players! \n\nTHROW, CATCH, TALK!\nYou and your partner \u2013 aspiring chefs \u2013 find yourselves in a quite impractical commercial kitchen. It\u2019s divided by a long serving counter, yet the products and the appliances you both need are placed on opposite sides of the room. Your job is to cooperate, cook together and serve orders of steaming, delicious food. Chop, stir and fry everything you can while throwing (at) your partner all the ingredients they need. Prove that cooking is a piece of cake as long as you do it together!\n\nFEATURES\n\u2022\tEverybody can have a taste. The game can be enjoyed by kids, teenagers, adults, and elders alike. Make cooking THE opportunity to forge new bonds and refine existing ones.\n\u2022\tUse your noodle. To complete orders as efficiently as possible, rely on your planning and communication skills; reflex and agility are considered a side dish in this kitchen.\n\u2022\tFresh challenges everyday. Each level brings new ingredients, appliances and recipes to the table, raising the difficulty level bit-by-bit. \n\u2022\tDifferent foods call for different measures. Earn stars to progress through the game. Unlock new restaurants, upgrade your cooking gear to meet ever-changing cooking standards, and gain access to new character skins. \n\u2022\tNever overeat on fun. Once you feel like you have no more room for cooperation, try alternative game modes, including \u201cBattle\u201d and \u201cEndless\u201d.",
