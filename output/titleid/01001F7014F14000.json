The Tower of Perpetuity is automatically regenerated by the game server every 24 hours (in real-world time), allowing for players around the world to take on the same dungeon each day, and for one day only. Different traps and gimmicks await you each day, and you must compete against other players while battling your way through. The dungeon contains various differing branches, offering a certain degree of free choice and randomization.\n\n\u25bcLight social elements\nSocial features utilizing the network have been implemented in the game, in which a gravestone will be placed where a player meets their end, appearing in other players\u2019 games along with their \u201crelics\u201d and \u201clast words\u201d. Take advantage of the different special skills afforded to each character and compete with other players as you struggle to surpass the countless bodies of your less fortunate rivals and fight your way through the impregnable dungeon.",
