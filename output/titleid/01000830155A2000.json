	"description": "One day, while Kumakichi is worried over what to eat for dinner, Nyanzou pauses from reading his manga to announce, \u201cI'm gonna be the King of the Pirates.\u201d Hearing what only could be a joke, Kumakichi thinks, \u201cNot again\u2026\u201d. He tries to ignore Nyanzou, but Nyanzou has a reputation for being reckless. He forces Kumakichi to come along out to sea.\n\nAnd as expected, Nyanzou\uff06Kumakichi get shipwrecked right after heading out.\nThey drift ashore onto a deserted island. \nHelp these two escape.\n\nIt's your standard escape game, on the easy side, and highly recommended for beginners. It comes with autosave, hints, and memo functions.",
