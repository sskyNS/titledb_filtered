	"description": "Players build towers by expertly arranging a variety of everyday items - from chairs and bananas to microwaves, washing machines, and statues. The challenge lies in balancing these unpredictable pieces. Stacking up 10 items gives your tower stability, but watch out! Any less and your tower could come crashing down. Stack up 50 items and watch your tower magically disappear, leaving behind your well-earned points. Competition escalates with an online leaderboard, as players from around the world vie to amass the most points in this whimsical, strategic game. Step into \"Item Tower\" and elevate ordinary objects into extraordinary adventures!",
