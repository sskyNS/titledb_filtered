	"description": "Promesa is a personal project born from a family conversation, where you wander through dreams and memories emerging from a dialogue between a grandfather and his grandchild.\nWhile listening to someone trying to remember their experiences, past and present blend together, forming a stream of images that are both personal and shared.\nFrom memories of homes and streets to surreal visions of imaginary places, Promesa is a contemplative experience about what happens when we\u2019re left dreaming of the things we haven\u2019t lived firsthand.\n\n- A slow and relaxing experience focused on contemplative exploration.\n- Every playthrough (of approximately 45 minutes) is different and it takes more than one to see all the scenes.\n- A distinct visual style that mixes pixel graphics with high-def light.\n- Visit dreamlike environments inspired by Argentinian and Italian cities.\n- A personal project born after a few conversations I had with my grandfather and made by a small team of 4 people.\n- An acoustic soundtrack that uses many different instruments: from piano and double-bass, to zither and harmonium.\n",
