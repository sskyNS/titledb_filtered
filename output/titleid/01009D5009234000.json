	"description": "Two cops, one case and only 24 hours to take them down... can you score the bust of a lifetime? Take the role of a loose cannon police detective and face off against criminal gangs in an exciting procedurally-generated action movie FPS. Join forces with a friend, online or locally, and take down those crooks in true buddy-cop style!\n\nAs a part of the RICO task force, your mission is clear: get in, take down the criminals and get out again. Sounds easy, but it's not - procedurally-generated cases mean you'll never know who or what's waiting for you. Pick your load-out, then use the element of surprise to get a tactical edge over the enemy. Unlock new weapons, mission types and traits, or dive into Daily Play and see how high you can climb the cop rankings! \n\n\u2022 Take down criminal gangs with extreme prejudice and solve the RICO case - you've only got 24 hours, detective!\n\n\u2022 Procedurally-generated cases mean no two games are ever the same - you'll never know what's waiting for you.\n\n\u2022 Crack cases with a friend, either online or locally, for co-op carnage. Two loose cannons are always better than one!\n\n\u2022 Daily Play cases - with leaderboards and rewards - keep you coming back for more, along with unlockable weapons, traits and mission types to discover.",
