	"description": "SELF is a Kafkaesque suspense text-based adventure game with simulation and puzzle mechanics.\n\nMy father vanishes, but only I know it.\nNobody else notices that, including my mother, even after I mentioned my father to them directly.\nI have to embark on a journey to find him back, all alone.\n\nIn this game, boundaries between dream, reality, memory, and truth are all diffuse.\nYou will meet many puzzles and challenges in it.\nYou need to make choices, which lead you to very different endings.\nYou will piece the clues and leads you collected together to a complete story.\nBut could you seize the opportunity to find your SELF in this introspective journey?\n\n- The whole story happens in an interactive retro screen;\n- Bullet hell mini-games inspired by Undertale and Just Shapes & Beats;\n- Unique interpretation with impressive pixel style line drawings and contagious emotional experience;\n- Fragment narration with multi-endings;",
