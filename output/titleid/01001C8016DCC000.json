	"description": "Monster Fruit Academy is an exciting parkour-style game. Experience challenges and adventures by working together, but still competing with one another, in single-player or four-player team modes. Players will be equipped with different types of cards and work together to become the best team of little monster warriors.\n\nLevels and Missions\nThe Monster Fruit world is filled with fantastic creatures; in this world, creatures seemingly identical from those in the real world can have unexpected powers.\nEmbark on a wondrous adventure, and complete progressively more demanding levels in a variety of scenarios. You may be battling through a mysterious land of water, climbing up unimaginably tall beanstalks, or running among scorching volcanoes. Each level will test the reflexes of the best little monster.\n\nEasy to Use/Diverse Challenges\nMonster Fruit Academy allows everyone to pick up the game quickly and have fun together, but in order for players to protect themselves during the chaos of battle, they must organize themselves and make the best out of their limited cards. Only a well-prepared and coordinated team can save the monster world and become the best team of little monsters.\n\nDifferent Gaming Modes\nAs the game progresses, a number of special challenge levels will be revealed. You can compete with your teammates to get the best score and become the MVP of the game.\n\nGet Moving for an Exciting Adventure!\n\n",
