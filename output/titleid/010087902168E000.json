	"description": "Monoquous 2 is a challenging puzzle platformer in which you can phase through walls to invert the world around you, taking the direction of gravity with it - up becomes down, black becomes white, and deadly obstacles lose and gain their threat along the way.\n\nSwitch on and off new walls and paths, scale long conveyors, and don't touch anything pointy... at least not in your own realm.\n\nMonoquous 2 features 130 levels. Each level also contains a hidden cat, a minimum phase and jump goal, a set of time trials, and beyond that are speedrun and permadeath modes. Finishing the game is fairly accessible, 100%ing it will test you.\n\nUnlock tints to pretend colour exists in this universe, and read an 80-line poem that unlocks as you find more and more cats.\n\nAlso features some accessibility options in which you can turn on or off things like graphical swaying and inversion.",
