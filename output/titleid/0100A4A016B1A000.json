Penny, the always-critical daughter of the mayor, dislikes the countryside and wants to transform the town into a modern tourist resort. The animals no longer get the attention they need, and the villagers no longer feel at home in the town.\n \nYour uncle, the mayor of Willowdale, needs your help to restore the town to its former glory. Save the village by setting up a lively farm, constructing buildings in town, and making friends with the colorful villagers. Will you be able to return the animals that have left and become feral back to the farm? Set off on an adventure and discover the surprising and beautiful life in Willowdale. \n \n \nBACK TO NATURE, BACK TO BASICS - Cultivate your green thumb by working day in, day out to restore the farm to its former glory!
