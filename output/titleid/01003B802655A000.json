	"description": "The gates creak open, and you step into a wasteland of rust, smoke, and forgotten machines. Engines whisper stories of their past lives, and piles of metal wait for a second chance. It\u2019s your job to bring the junkyard back to life\u2014or let it swallow you whole.\n\nTake the wheel of your truck and carve a path through twisted wrecks and shattered dreams. Scavenge for scrap, uncover hidden treasures buried beneath the rust, and decide what\u2019s worth saving. Every haul means cash, every upgrade takes you closer to control.\n\nPiece by piece, rebuild the broken. Organize the chaos. Watch as your junkyard transforms from a graveyard of steel into a thriving empire of rebirth. But keep your eyes open\u2014this place has a strange memory, and not everything that\u2019s buried wants to stay that way.\n\nRust, grease, and questionable business decisions\u2014congratulations, you\u2019re officially an entrepreneur.",
