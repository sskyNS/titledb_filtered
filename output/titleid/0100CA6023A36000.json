	"description": "SCP: CONTROL ERROR is a short, first-person psychological horror game set in 1985\n\nYou are Barry Gittings - a man who volunteered for a classified experiment inside the Vortex Complex, a remote underground facility established during the Cold War.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s behind the next door.\nYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s watching.\nYou only know the doors opened, the voice welcomed you, and the test began.\n\nExplore sealed research chambers. Solve strange cognitive trials. Read internal reports and documents left behind by those who came before - or maybe didn\u2019t leave at all.\n\nNo jump scares. No gunfights. Just you, the test, and something you can\u2019t quite see.",
