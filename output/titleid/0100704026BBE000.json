	"description": "Build a waterpark that\u2019s louder, splashier, and slightly more chaotic than anyone planned. Start with a patch of land and a few modest slides, then turn it into a full-blown splash factory packed with looping rides, giant pools, and attractions that make guests question their life choices\u2014in a good way.\n\nAt first, it\u2019s all on you. You\u2019ll sell tickets, serve snacks, fix broken pumps, and scoop lost flip-flops out of the wave pool. As the crowds grow, so does the madness. Slides clog, kids cannonball where they shouldn\u2019t, and someone always forgets sunscreen. Welcome to management.\n\nDesign every corner your way. Paint slides in wild colors, rearrange pool layouts, add decorations, and build the kind of place people brag about surviving. The physics keep things lively\u2014expect dramatic belly flops, slippery wipeouts, and the occasional \u201cI meant to do that\u201d moment.\n\nExpand your park, hire staff to handle the chaos, and keep visitors happy with food, drinks, and just enough safety to keep things interesting. Because here, the goal isn\u2019t just to build a waterpark\u2014it\u2019s to build the one everyone talks about on the ride home\u2026 preferably for the right reasons.",
