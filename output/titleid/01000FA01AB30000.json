	"description": "In a modern fantasy world, college dropout Grace is granted the power of a Muse - power she\u2019ll need to find out the truth behind her predecessor\u2019s death before time runs out. You\u2019ll decide who Grace allies with, who she can trust, and who may betray her in this beautifully hand-illustrated roleplaying musical.\n\nWritten by David Gaider comes Stray Gods - an urban fantasy tale of finding your place, taking charge of your fate, and discovering answers. Your choices will change the endings, as well as the path you take to get there.\n\nA compelling story of hope, self-discovery, and forging your path.\n\nFind Your Voice\nAdventure, love, and songs await!\n\nCharm, negotiate, or strong-arm your way through their world as Grace, playing through original, fully interactive musical numbers composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory, Tripod (musicians Scott Edgar, Steven Gates, and Simon Hall) and Eurovision Australia\u2019s own Montaigne (Jess Cerro). Fully orchestrated and performed by an all-star cast, you\u2019ll feel as though you\u2019re right there on the stage. With thousands of potential variations based on your choices, you\u2019ll craft the soundtrack to your own one of a kind musical experience.\n\nFind Answers\nChoice and consequence built from the DNA of RPGs - no two playthroughs are the same.\n\nDelve into a hidden world of mythic Greek gods and monsters as you get to know a cast of hilarious, enigmatic, and compelling characters. Forget what you know about these mythological beings - in Stray Gods you\u2019ll forge friendships and find foes with many familiar names, but not so familiar stories. Play as star and stagehand as you determine the story you want to tell through conversation and song.\n\nFind Love?\nFind friendship, love, or yourself.\n\nBuild friendships with mortals and Gods alike. Stoke the fires of romance if you so choose - explore, pursue, and confess your love with four potential paramours. Decide who you want to be through every choice. David Gaider\u2019s storytelling and characters come to life with performances by an all-star cast, with the likes of Laura Bailey, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn  and more cast members across video games, television, and Broadway to be revealed soon.\n\nA Whole New World\nA musical for video game lovers, and a video game for musical lovers.\n\nWith all the comedy and tragedy of your favorite stage shows, Stray Gods is a tongue-in-cheek and heartfelt reconception of Greek mythology combining what we love about contemporary musical theater with video games where character and story take center stage. Collaborating with some of the best in music, broadway, television, and games - Stray Gods is a debut not to be missed.",
