	"description": "The world has fallen into chaos. A deadly outbreak has turned the city into a quarantine zone, and now, in total blackout, the undead roam free. With no power, no safe zones, and only the weapons you can find, survival is a brutal fight against endless waves of zombies lurking in the shadows.\n\nEvery bullet counts. Every flickering light could be your last hope - or your final mistake. Scavenge, fortify, and fight back against the relentless horde in this intense low-poly action shooter. The darkness is closing in, and the infected are everywhere. Will you escape the quarantine, or become part of the undead nightmare?",
