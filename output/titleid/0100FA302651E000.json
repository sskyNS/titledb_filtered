	"description": "Get ready to flap your wings and fire up your brain, because the hummingbird is about to turn the garden into a festival of logic. Hummingbird Garden is a charming pixel-art puzzle where you push little pollen nuggets through tight pathways until each flower blooms in a colorful display. It is the perfect mix of calm thinking, strategy, and a touch of natural magic.\n\nYou study the garden, choose the best route, avoid getting stuck, and decide the right order to deliver each pollen nugget. There is no rush. Every move can be undone with Undo or tried again with Restart, letting you experiment freely until you find the most elegant solution. It is a game made for thinking peacefully and enjoying every small discovery.\n\nWith 30 handcrafted levels divided into two biomes, the gardens offer varied terrain, natural obstacles, and many satisfying moments when flowers light up to celebrate your success. Each level feels like a small pollination mission, and completing one gives that delightful sense of making the world a little more beautiful.",
