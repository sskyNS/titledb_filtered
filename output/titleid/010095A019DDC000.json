	"description": "Congrats on becoming the newest hire of Salamander County's public TV station (SCPTV)! \n\n...Unfortunately, everyone in the county suddenly disappeared, except for you, your boss, and another employee. \n\nBut the show must go on, so with your new job title of Professional Thing-Doer, it's up to you to do all of the activities that need to be filmed for the TV station. \n\n(You should probably try and figure out why everyone disappeared in the first place, too.)\n\nFeatures:\n* twenty-five (25) different minigames\n* bronze, silver, and gold medal targets for each minigame\n* pretty much everything's a stock photo\n* a funny story involving a mouse with really big legs\n* lots of REALLY dumb videos",
