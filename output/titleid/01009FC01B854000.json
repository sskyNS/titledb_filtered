	"description": "Powers of Hex is a heavily inspired, non-linear experience that should elicit memories of classic, 2D platformers from the 80s.\n\nWhile the nostalgic visuals and sound have you feeling good, it is your task to play as Hex on a quest to obtain all 6, unique, magic powers from Elfvis. Are you really the bad guy if Elfvis is keeping your true potential from you?\n\nMake your way from the title screen, straight into the action. Just pick your first theme and start the stage. No boring tutorial needed to hold you back!\nThe stage layouts are each specifically designed to transparently teach you as you play.\n\nLearning as you play, use the selection menu to switch to whichever magic spell you prefer for the current, evolving challenges you will face.\nThere will be many and they will vary, but Elfvis waits for you at the end of each area. Overpower those guys, outwit their behavioral patterns and you shall net yourself a brand new ability to experiment with.\nTake their power and become a true wizard.\n\n...And if you should manage to skillfully overcome all that is laid out before you? A final path forward shall open to let you really test your developed talents, but you'll really have to prove you are worthy first.",
