	"intro": "Space. Dice. And Cannibalism. Tharsis is a turn-based, space survival strategy game where outcomes and actions are based on dice rolls and difficult moral decisions.",
	"description": "A mysterious signal coming from the Tharsis region of Mars sets your crew of astronauts off on a risky mission. Who sent it? And why? Impossible questions, but your fate is sealed on finding out. Now, millions of miles away from home, a micrometeoroid storm damaged your spaceship and killed two vital members of your crew. The mission is no longer just discovery, but to survive the journey with those still left alive.\n\nTharsis is built around a unique mix of a board game and video game mechanics. The outcomes of your choices are determined by rolls of the dice, but ultimately it is up to you and your decisions that will affect the mission\u2019s success. Guide your crew through onboard disasters, food shortages, and the unforgiving nature of space. Maintain what remains of their health and sanity as they are strained by a crumbling ship, lack of food and the strange and disturbing signals coming from the Red Planet.\n\nSucceeding in Tharsis requires you to make the best of what you have, even if everything indicates failure. Certain factors may be outside of your control, but that doesn't mean they can't be overcome. Be ready to plan and adapt continually. The game offers three levels of difficulty - easy for a fair learning curve, normal for those wanting a tough but fair challenge and hard for the true challenge seekers.\n\nDefy the odds, make the difficult decisions, and embark on a harrowing mission of survival and fate.\n\nFeatures: \n\n\n- Turn-based space survival strategy game. With dice. And cannibalism\n\n- A unique mix of a board game and video game mechanics. Make tough tactical and moral choices with the outcome then determined by the roll of your dice.
