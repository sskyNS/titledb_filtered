Sensitive to the judgment of others, she has lived her life alone in space.\n\nHowever, these peaceful days come to an abrupt end when Laurie's space pod is destroyed in the aliens' attacks.\nThe destroyed pod somehow crash lands on Colony 102, where a secret weapon intended to repel the enemy aliens is stashed away. Now, the fate of all humanity rests in the hands of one eccentric girl.\n\n\nExploration-Based Action:\nRun through the expansive colony while mastering new skills, obtaining gear, and exploring unknown areas. \n\nBefore long, the story expands outside the colony into outer space!
