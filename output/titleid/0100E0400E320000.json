	"intro": "Become a mighty Warlock in this action-packed, humorous RPG and slay the arrogant Gods that dared to stand in your way. Challenge them alone or with up to 4 friends in local co-op.",
	"description": "In God Slayers you take on the role of one of the members of The Order of Warlocks. This time around you\u2019ll have to face a much bigger threat, than in the original game. By slashing hordes of shadow monsters in the past, Warlocks have angered the Gods, who now turned against them. In result, you can now either give up, ask for mercy and then quietly die, as \u201cmercy\u201d is not a word easily found in Dark Gods\u2019 vocabulary. \u00a0Or you could release all your godlike powers instead and make the Gods pay for their betrayal.\n\nBe sure though, that they\u2019re not willing to go without a fight and they\u2019ll throw at you all kinds of seemingly hilarious pixel art opponents. Don't be fooled by their funny looks however as rest assured, they\u2019ll use any means necessary including their special skill sets to take you down. With the aid of giant bosses they will bring your skills to the test. Slay or get slain. There\u2019s no other way.\n\nIn Warlocks 2: God Slayers you\u2019ll find:\n\u25cf Hilarious pixel art with hand-drawn animations;\n\u25cf Dynamic hack'n\u2019slash experience in solo and local co-op;\n\u25cf More than 40 types of challenging enemies that work together to take you down, using their unique skill sets;\n\u25cf Extensive maps with tons of randomly generated loot to be picked up;\n\u25cf 5 different types of Warlocks to pick up from, each with their own abilities to unlock throughout the game;\n\u25cf 8-10 hours of gameplay to complete the adventure with one Warlock\n\u25cf Varied powerful and enormous bosses only waiting to get slain.",
