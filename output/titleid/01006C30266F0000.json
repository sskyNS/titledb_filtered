Use the fuel to boost through enemies, fly straight up walls, and stick to ceilings in order to complete over 120 handcrafted challenges!\n\nEXPLORE RUN-DOWN SHIPS\nBattle vengeful Viking ghosts aboard the Sea Dragon. Dig in for an unsavory meal aboard the Chunky Chacken, where you\u2019ll discover a man-eating chicken outbreak. Finally, get ready for some monkey business at The Sweater Factory, an abandoned workshop run by an unexpected crew of apes causing all the ruckus. Each chapter holds a Master Gear, guarded by an ultimate boss.\n\nMASTER GEAR, HO!\nBattle the legendary Skraken, Metal Beak the Momma Chacken, and... Gerald. Face these colorful 'n crusty foes to retrieve the Master Gears and repair your cannon. Blast yourself to a stranded seaplane to escape The Seahole, a mysterious sinking hole in the ocean\u2026 before ye end up in Davy Jones' Locker!\n\nCREATED AND DEVELOPED BY OH MY ME GAMES",
