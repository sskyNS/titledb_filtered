	"description": "This morning, on the newspaper :\n\n\"Crypto Is Dead\", this is what you can read everywhere on social networks and in the street. A 51% attack against the global cryptocurrency succeeded yesterday, paralyzing the entire global economy.\nTo remedy the problem and give itself time to get the system back on track, the Central Bank has decided to put the old physical currency back into circulation.\nIn order to do this, it is asking the banks to equip themselves and to find people qualified in banknote verification.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that the situation will remain in this state for a month.\n\nWe will follow this situation closely to keep our loyal readers informed.\"\n\nArticle by Ranf Bardern\n\nFinally, the opportunity you've been waiting for has come to you. You, notaphilist since your youngest age, will finally be able to make a living out of your passion and who knows, maybe even get rich?\n\nArmed with your encyclopedia on old bill, you set up your new business, acquire your bill sending machine and open your bank, the day after this news.\n\nFor the next month, you'll have to help the financial system get back on its feet by checking whether the bills deposited in your bank are real bills... or fake ones.\n\nYou will start with only your encyclopedia and your knowledge. Get a bill, find the error, send your expertise to the central bank, gain reputation, get more customers, buy material from the dozen machines available to follow the demand and start again.\nAll this, during only 30 days... Eh, simple, no?\n\nMaybe cryptocurrency is dead, but you are alive and well and ready to work.",
