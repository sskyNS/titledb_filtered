	"description": "It was a time when people had forgotten their dreams and lost faith.\nThe silhouettes of goddesses revealed themselves to people who, at the time, could only believe in what they saw in front of them.\n\nThe confusion surrounding the countless goddesses appearing in Japan was soon solved through the reveal that Japan\u2019s guardian deity, Amaterasu, wanted to teach the goddesses about the human world.\nAll of this brought about the implementation of the Divine Education Act.\nA year passed and numerous goddesses and humans got to learn about each other, got to know one another, and came to a mutual understanding.\n\nThe subculture holy land and heart of Divine Idol culture, known as Akihabara, housed the seven lucky goddesses that dominated as idols in L\u2606SEVEN.\n\nNext Generation Goddess Auditions!\nDivine Idol chicks, go on to spread your wings!\nA glamorous and splendid contest is being held, containing everything that goddess's dreams are made of!\n\nLaugh, grow, and even cry with the goddesses who descended from the sky and are aiming to become top level idols.",
