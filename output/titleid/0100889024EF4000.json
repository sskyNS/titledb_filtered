	"description": "Suika Sprunki Edition is a vibrant arcade puzzle game inspired by the classic Suika formula, but with the unmistakable madness of the Sprunki universe. Drop character heads into a container and watch them bounce, collide, and merge into strange, evolving forms. What starts as a simple mechanic quickly becomes a thrilling challenge of timing, precision, and strategy. Don\u2019t let the box overflow\u2014score high and unlock even weirder evolutions.\n\nBut beware: as your score climbs, the game begins to shift. The cheerful rhythm stutters, the atmosphere darkens, and before you know it, you\u2019ve slipped into Horror Mode, where familiar faces twist into something uncanny and the music begins to press on your nerves. It\u2019s the same game\u2014but seen through a distorted mirror.\n\nInside you\u2019ll find:\n\n\u2013 Beloved Sprunki characters: merge, explode, and watch them evolve\n\u2013 A soundtrack that sticks with you: from playful tunes to unsettling hums\n\u2013 A bold and slightly unhinged visual style: mesmerizing from the first drop\n",
