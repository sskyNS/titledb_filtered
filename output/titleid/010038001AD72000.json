These are tough guys best to avoid. \nWe will have to draw graffiti, smear public housing with paint and damage it. Become the one that no one messes with,\nbut the one that the police are looking for intensively because of his hooliganisms.\nAll these graffiti are posted by us and we get reputation in the networks, the higher the reputation, the more money we get.The most important thing is to know how to protect ourselves after every damage done to the city, we have to be careful not to be caught by the police and to see our interests through.",
