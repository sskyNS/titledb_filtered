	"description": "Immerse into the fantastical world of imagination.\n\nIn Aery - Dreamscape you play as a bird-like spirit who can enter the minds of other people in order to explore their thoughts, their secrets, and their imagination.\n\nEach person has their own imaginary world and each world represents the thoughts, fears, and ambitions of that person in an interesting and mostly abstract way. \n\nWithin an imaginary world, you have to find a certain amount of memory shards to advance with the story and to get to know more about the person in question. Once you have found all memory shards you are free to leave the world again and search for the next mind you want to explore. \n\nTherefore every single imagination world acts as its own small story with its very own theme, design elements, and obstacles.\n\nExperience the feeling of flying, immerse into beautiful and atmospheric landscapes and enjoy the unique storytelling of the game while getting to know a lot of interesting people on the way.",
