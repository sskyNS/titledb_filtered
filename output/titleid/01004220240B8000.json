	"description": "In this new adventure, Simon, the most sarcastic wizard in video game history, returns to reveal secrets and stories from his past! \n\nA New Journey Begins! \n\nThirty years after his first appearance on the screen, Simon is drawn into a foreign world by an ancient prophecy, that will tell his origins. This world is populated by powerful yet mostly useless wizards and strange creatures. On his journey, Simon must solve a series of tricky puzzles, operate alchemical devices, and learn powerful spells. And yes, he also has to taste a few disgusting stews! \n\nPuzzles, Magic, and Simon\u2019s Humor \n\nWhether you're visiting the Magical World for the first time or returning once again \u2013 Simon is back, along with his unique sense of humor and a completely new graphic style. Simon the Sorcerer Origins brings the charm of the original saga back in a completely hand-drawn graphic style, blending classic gameplay mechanics with a fresh, new world of magic. \n\nYour Adventure, Your Puzzles \n\nSolve loads of tricky puzzles, test your wits, and face a variety of absurd situations and quirky characters. Combine items and clues to unravel the big mystery and become the legendary wizard you were always meant to be.   \n\nFeatures:\n\n-\tOfficial prequel to the cult series: Find out what Simon was up to just before his first magical misstep into the fantasy world, long before he started insulting talking doors. \n\n-\tA story with heart, humour, and a hat: Between motherly love, a forced move, and a healthy dose of chaos, Simon\u2019s journey to becoming an (unwilling) hero begins. \n\n-\tHand-drawn art style & iconic voice: Featuring lovingly hand-drawn graphics and Simon\u2019s original voice, performed by British voice actor Chris Barrie, this feels like a trip back to the \u201990s, just with far better resolution. \n\n-\tBetween magic spells and cogs: Classic point-and-click gameplay meets modern mechanics. Solve quirky puzzles, crack ancient mechanisms, and collect (as always) way too many items. \n\n-\tSarcasm, slapstick, and eccentric wizards: Encounter bizarre characters, delight in even odder conversations, and revel in Simon\u2019s unmistakable wit: equal parts cheeky banter and \u201cvery British\u201d humour. \n\n-\tAlchemy, magic & other mishaps: Tinker with spells, fiddle with alchemical contraptions, and dabble in questionable recipes. With a sprinkle of luck, the thing you were trying to do could very well happen.",
