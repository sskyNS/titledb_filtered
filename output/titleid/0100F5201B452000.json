	"intro": "\u201cI\u2019m the Batter. I\u2019ve been entrusted with a sacred mission.\u201d\nOne of the most influential RPGs of the last 20 years is finally coming to Nintendo Switch\u2122.",
	"description": "Allow me to confess that I find you quite tangible for a phantasmagorical being.\n\nI must say, this is really quite strange. You are the first living being I have ever met in this place. Nevertheless, I will introduce myself. I am the Judge.\n\nThe Batter has a sacred mission to fulfill.\n\nHe seeks to purify the world. You, then, the controller, the soul that he harbors, must aid him in this laudable task. Alongside my sportive companion you will find it necessary to solve puzzles, rain blows upon certain hostile individuals of our wild zones, and oversee the headways and logistics of a network of swan boats and interurban locomotives.\n\nI, too, travel widely among the zones of this world.\n\nOpen your wings and fly toward the zones ahead without hesitation! All of them are filled with strange and enchanting beings as well as every modern convenience. All of them appear, it must be said, to require the beneficent application of our friend the Batter\u2019s muscular wrist. Do not worry, my dear phantasm\u2014I, the Judge, will be with you (in spirit and body) at all the most crucial moments of your quest.\n\n* Uncover the secrets of an uncanny world of commanding a being known as The Batter.\n* Crush the specters with the help of an all-new battlesystem.\n* Purify the Queen's Zones so her citizens can get back to work.\n* Find a rollercoaster too scary to ride, a library terrorized by a page thief, a mall that you can't escape.\n* All-new areas and bosses designed by the game's creator, Mortis Ghost.\n* Perhaps you might meet The Judge's friend Zacharie as well.",
