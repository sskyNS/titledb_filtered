	"description": "Imperial year 248.\n\nThe empire is in the midst of deteriorating security, hopeless diplomatic relations, and endless war. The oppressed people of the devastated society believe in the apocalypse, and soon a huge armed organization rises up.\n\nPeople were kidnapped by the organization and disappeared one by one. The empire sent its own troops to the organization, but they were all destroyed.\n\nThe imperial army, unable to devote its strength to the country due to the worsening war situation with neighboring countries, transferred one gal to an armed organization, Galwoya.\n\nHer name? Saki \u201cHell Smasher\u201d Daigokuin. And she is the empire\u2019s last hope.\n\nCULT VS GAL is a fast-paced, old-school FPS packed with high-octane action. Your job? To step into the shoes of Saki \u201cHell Smasher\u201d Daigokuin and annihilate the cult that threatens the empire. Complete with seven different versions of the ending theme song!",
