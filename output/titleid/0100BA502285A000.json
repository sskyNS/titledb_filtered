This 6-mile stretch of coastline, surrounded by 100-foot cliffs, housed formidable German defences. At 6.30am, soldiers from the US 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions began their assault. They encountered fierce German resistance. Many died before leaving their landing craft, while those who reached the beach faced relentless enemy fire.\n\nThe coastline was mined and covered with barbed wire, forcing troops to cross 200-300 yards of dangerous sand. German forces decimated landing craft and armoured vehicles with 88mm anti-tank guns and 75mm field guns. Snipers in hidden cliff positions targeted American officers and radio operators, while mortar teams unleashed a constant barrage.\n\nStill, small groups of brave soldiers tried to break through the hail of bullets. Their courage offered hope against a potentially catastrophic failure. Although heavy casualties were expected, the Allies were able to secure a crucial foothold.\nA historic battle that could be the turning point of the Second World War is about to begin.",
