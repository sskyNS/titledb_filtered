Play single player against kitty-bot opponents! \n\nThis version of the game includes the Streaking Kittens, Party Pack, Betrayal Pack, and Barking Kittens expansions, exclusive cards, and hilarious illustrations by The Oatmeal. \n\nWith millions of games sold and downloaded, Exploding Kittens is the perfect card game for players of all ages who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats. \n\n\"It's like UNO, except there are goats, magical enchiladas and kittens that can kill you.\" -CNN",
