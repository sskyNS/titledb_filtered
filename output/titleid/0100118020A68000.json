Add buildings like restaurants and teahouses to make your town a place where samurai and commoners alike will want to live.\n\nThis is the past, so don't forget to add some touches of traditional culture! Features like temples and gaming halls can give your city a lot of personality, especially when arranged in harmony with the surrounding environment. You might end up attracting tourists to the town, who will move in if they like it enough.\n\nIt's not all fun and games in the mists of history. Sometimes ghost, demons, and other baddies will come to attack your city. You'll have to summon your own Guardian Spirits to banish the evil ones and keep your townsfolk safe. Consider your spirits' abilities and placement for the best effects - strategy is the key word!\n\nWith a whole host of land expansion options, facilities, and residents to collect and customize, it's never been easier to create a city that will go down in history.\nStart building your ancient city today!\n\nTry searching for \"Kairosoft\" to see all of our games!!",
