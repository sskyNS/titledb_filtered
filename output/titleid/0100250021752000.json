From the world\u2019s decay, ancient creatures stir, rise, and roam the land.\n\nVessels of Decay is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure following the story of Freja and Mud. In this retro-inspired tale, you\u2019ll confront creatures of Scandinavian myth and folklore, and explore the ruins of the civilization they inhabit.\n\n- Dynamic Battle System: How you execute combat \u2013 and how your enemies perish \u2013 is entirely up to you!\n\n- Unique Finishers: Every new enemy is a new opportunity for you to show your flair for combat; stagger your foes to set them up for (literally) killer animations and flourishes.\n\n- Epic Multi-Stage Boss Encounters: The beasts of Scandinavian folklore will not let themselves be put down so easily, and you\u2019ll have to use your wits and reflexes to pursue and slay them!\n\n- Explore A Beautiful World of Pixels, Death, and Decay: Vessels of Decay is a completely handcrafted world, with care and thought poured into each and every scene, story beat, and environment.\n\n- A Scandinavian Take on Classic Action-Adventure: The battered ruins of a once-modern society clash with the renewed growth of nature \u2013 and of the supernatural. Explore a uniquely Scandinavian setting through a mix of reflective melancholy, exploration, and fast-paced action. ",
