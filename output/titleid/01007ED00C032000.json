	"description": "Sparklite is an action-adventure set in the whimsical and ever-changing land of Geodia. Battle foes in top-down action using an arsenal of gadgets, guns, and gear. Explore dangerous corners of the procedurally generated world, take down titans of the mining industry, and harness the power of Sparklite!\n\nEverything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite... it's the life force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power with grave consequences. Geodia\u2019s self-titled \"Baron\" has devised a plot to mine the world\u2019s Sparklite core to meet his own ends. Mining Sparklite in large quantities, the Baron repurposes the ore to fuel his powerful war machines, but the pollution from the consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world. Animals have turned into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.\n\nThe stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a Disruption which rearranges the world, setting back the Baron\u2019s efforts. Our heroine, Ada, must stop the Baron before he can obtain the core and gain the power to create a new world in which he has ultimate power. A plucky mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills to defeat the Baron\u2019s henchmen across five distinct zones. Ada will have to work with Geodia\u2019s weird and wonderful inhabitants if she\u2019s to face the Baron and put paid to his deadly plans before it\u2019s too late. \n\nOur hero, Ada, must travel to each zone of the world to shut down the Baron\u2019s Digsites before it\u2019s too late...\n\nKey Features\n\u2022\tStunning visuals - Intricate pixel art aesthetic inspired by retro classics\n\u2022\tOriginal soundtrack - GameCube inspired soundtrack by composer Dale North (Wizard of Legend)\n\u2022\tExplore the world of Sparklite - Five beautiful, procedurally generated biomes\n\u2022\tInvent your arsenal - Invent gadgets to solve puzzles and defeat enemies\n\u2022\tBattle bosses - Take on the Baron Mining Corp and its formidable gremlin Titans\n\u2022\tMeet the locals - Befriend the people of Geodia and help build The Refuge\n\u2022\tHunt collectibles - Discover collectibles scattered throughout the world\n\u2022\tBuddy up! - Rescue Ada\u2019s robotic sidekick to play local assistive co-op with a friend\n",
