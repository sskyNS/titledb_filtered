You must also consider the weight of the truck when cornering, monitor tyre wear and find the best tactics for overtaking.\n\nThe official FIA ETRC game is a completely new option for all fans of racing sims.\n\u2022 45 trucks with their official livery, including top manufacturers like Volvo, Man, Freightliner and Western Star\n\u2022 20 teams and the championship's best drivers\n\u2022 14 circuits including official ETRC ones,  as well as Laguna Seca, Circuit of The Americas and Fuji Speedway\n\u2022 5 single-player modes and 5 multiplayer modes",
