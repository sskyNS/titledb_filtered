	"description": "The teams at Mighty Yell and 13AM Games have taken one of Atari\u2019s most iconic titles and created a high-pressure, tactical turn-based game where players must manage their pool of defenses strategically to survive rounds of incoming missiles.\n\nMissile Command Delta approaches gameplay in a completely new way, but it retains all the tension and suspense of the arcade original. You have to think strategically about every move you make because even one poor choice can have grave consequences. The turn-based strategy game is wrapped in a twisting, narrative thriller \u2013 great for mystery fans, completionists, and players that love to explore and solve puzzles.\n\nBetween inbound missile alerts, investigate the underground bunker to access locked rooms, uncover secrets, and strengthen your arsenal. Will you be able to unravel the mystery in time?\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Turn-Based Strategy: A totally unique strategy experience. New missile and enemy types are uncovered when you explore deeper into the bunker.\n\n- Plan Your Defense: Every turn is critical, and one poor choice can spell disaster. Plan your next move, and map out a cascade of explosions that take out multiple enemy missiles to help conserve your resources.\n\n- High-Stakes Mystery: The turn-based strategy game is wrapped in a high-stakes narrative puzzle. Read every document, watch your every step, and ace every puzzle if you want to [REDACTED].\n\n- Experience the Cold War: A claustrophobic retro-future aesthetic of dusty command consoles and supercomputers place you deep into Cold War paranoia.",
