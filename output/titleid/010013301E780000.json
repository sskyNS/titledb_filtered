	"description": "From the creators of Paradise Killer comes the world\u2019s first (and best) Open World Mascot Management Crime Drama: this is Promise Mascot Agency. \n\nCrime! Drama! Intrigue! What has happened to Michi?\n\nMichi, a disgraced yakuza lieutenant, is exiled to a cursed town to turn a bankrupt mascot agency into a profitable enterprise. As he struggles in his new life, can he manage to make a successful business and unravel the conspiracy behind his exile? He\u2019s helped by Assistant Manager Pinky, who happens to be a mascot herself. \n\nA new home to explore! What secrets will you discover in your adorable Kei Truck?\n\nExplore Michi\u2019s new home of Kaso-Machi in his run-down (but upgradable!) truck. There\u2019s plenty to discover in this forgotten Japanese town - new friends to make, collectibles to find (and destroy), other businesses to partner with and, most importantly, a variety of mascots to recruit. \n\nMascots! Living, breathing creatures of untold flesh! Can you befriend them?\n\nAs we all know, mascots are living creatures that have coexisted with mankind since the dawn of history. Mascots have their own hopes, dreams and desires and you\u2019ll need to negotiate to recruit them. Some mascots want money, some want fame, some want a rice ball from the local convenience store and some want to see the entire world burn to ashes in glorious hellfire. Who will be your favourite?\n\nWatch out, mascots! Will the job be completed successfully?\n\nOnce they\u2019re on the books, mascots can be trained and sent out on a variety of jobs to make money, gain experience and spread the name of the Promise Mascot Agency far and wide! Of course, jobs don\u2019t always go to plan - whether it\u2019s a narrow doorway, kitchens catching on fire or dreadful nightmare spirits, danger lurks around every corner. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you to assist your imperilled employee using Hero Cards, cards representing a variety of characters you\u2019ll meet during your days in Kaso-Machi. With tactical card usage, your mascot can overcome any challenge and win hearts, minds and a healthy paycheque. \n\nGo go, Michi and Pinky! Solve the mystery and create a home for mascots everywhere!
