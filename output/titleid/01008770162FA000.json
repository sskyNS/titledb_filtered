	"description": "Send your serfs to fight and die in your name... or let them prosper and use them to your advantage!\n\nCollect taxes and resources. Dictate rations and field work. Forge weapons, raise armies, and build mighty fortified cities. Help your people become knights, or dump them on a battlefield far away, but be careful: even the most humble peasants will revolt eventually and an unlucky event card can change the fate of your realm quickly...\n\nBe ready to expand your realm or defend your provinces! Relationships with other Lords are a fickle thing and you will find yourself on the battlefield sooner or later. Raise a well-rounded army, give yourself an edge through a card-based skill system and engage your enemies in mortal combat in highly tactical, grid- and turn-based encounters!\n\nIn addition to its campaign mode, Rising Lords features robust multiplayer functionality.
