	"intro": "Caligo is a small atmospheric walking simulator. It's an interactive story where you mainly have to look and listen.",
	"description": "Caligo is the darkness everyone descends into one way or another, and to each of us it's something different. For some it's a short but exciting adventure, some will see it as a place to relax. Yet others will be reminded of their worst nightmare, while for a few, it might come as a revelation. One thing is certain however: everyone will have to answer one big question.\n\nWhat you'll find there:\n- Various characters - each will have their own connection to the story\n- Unusual settings, each with its own unique atmosphere\n- 100% voiced dialogs which actually make sense and which will eventually form the full story of the protagonist \n- A choice that'll help understand yourself better",
