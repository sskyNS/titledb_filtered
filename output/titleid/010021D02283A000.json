	"description": "Higgs Boson Collection is a trilogy of brain-bending puzzle games where every rotation counts and every second matters. Your mission? Guide mysterious spheres through a precise network of pathways \u2014 but there's a twist: you don\u2019t move the spheres\u2026 you rotate the world around them.\n\nAcross three distinct games, you\u2019ll dive into increasingly mind-challenging scenarios:\n\nMinimal Puzzle \u2013 The calm before the storm. This minimalist experience eases you into the core mechanics. Rotate shapes. Match paths. Watch spheres align. Some shapes are linked \u2014 turn one, and others follow. It\u2019s simple\u2026 until it\u2019s not.\n\nChallenging Puzzle \u2013 Planning becomes essential. Here, every move is precious. Rotate too many times and the level resets. Think ahead. Visualize your solution. Be efficient. This is where the puzzle starts to fight back.\n\nTimed Puzzle \u2013 The clock is ticking. Instead of counting moves, you\u2019re racing against time. Some figures rotate, others slide \u2014 and if time runs out, it\u2019s game over. Quick thinking and sharp reflexes are your best allies.\n\nWith sleek visuals, ambient gradient backgrounds, and zero distractions, the focus stays where it belongs \u2014 on the puzzle. Each level ramps up the difficulty, pushing your logic, memory, and speed to their limits. Whether you\u2019re a casual thinker or a hardcore strategist, Higgs Boson Collection invites you to think differently.",
