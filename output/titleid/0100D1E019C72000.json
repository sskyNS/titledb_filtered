	"description": "The story takes place in an old stronghold, at the last days of a great battle. You died, but your will was stronger than your body, so you woke up again, to continue the siege in a never-ending night.\n\nRemembering little more than your purpose, you'll have to leave the dungeons, advance through the stronghold's outskirts, and reach the highest tower. To find the Heir and finally end your curse.\n\n\u00b7 Explore\nNon-linear map where you'll be unlocking access to new places once you have acquired special items or abilities within the game.\n\n\u00b7 Fight your way in\nFast paced combat focused on skill, where every enemy is different from the others and even the more harmless looking one can be deadly. With three difficulty modes, you can adapt the game to your own tastes, in case you want a challenge or you are just in for the adventure.\n\n\u00b7 Equip yourself\nMultiple weapons with very different movesets that completely change the gameplay, and the way you face the different challenges of the game.\n\u00b7 Learn secrets\nMeet different characters that, as you, woke up with a blurry purpose to follow and discover their stories.",
