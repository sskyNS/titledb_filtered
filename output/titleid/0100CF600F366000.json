You will have to build and manage cities, provide resources for your inhabitants while making sure there are enough workers to sustain your production lines. Trade with others cities, honor the requests of the Emperor and make your citizens happy.\n\nHistory:\nWith the discovery of condensed steam as a source of energy, the world of Lethis sees an unprecedented Industrial Revolution. As a result, the Empire enters a period of urbanisation. New cities are built everywhere. This rural exodus leads to new towns in strategical places to ensure the growth of the Empire. A time of great change is also a right time for new discoveries and innovation in science. Cities are built around great monuments like gigantic zeppelin hangars and observatories.\"\n\nFeatures:\nA campaign mode containing 26 missions with 3 difficulty levels\nA sandbox mode for unlimited fun\nOver 24 different resources to manage\nMore than 40 different buildings and 4 unique Monuments\nOver fifteen different characters that roam the city\nMaps that reach up to 300 per 300 box tiles\nAn amazing soundtrack with over 20 different songs\n\nThis Nintendo Switch\u2122 version includes new features such as gamepad controls (and partly touch screen), new user interface to perfectly fit the Nintendo Switch\u2122 screen and a smoother difficulty curve!",
