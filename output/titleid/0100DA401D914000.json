Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.\n\n*This game uses the Japanese ROM for the main part of the game.\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
