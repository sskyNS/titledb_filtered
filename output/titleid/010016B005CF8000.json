	"description": "Play through the Knight campaign as you battle against the tribal Lizardmen or enjoy the groundbreaking PvP combat system that will deliver fast-paced real-time strategy action or tactical turn-based gameplay. Multiplayer allows either game mode, while single-player focuses entirely on real-time strategic gameplay.\n\nThe objective of each battle is to destroy the opponent\u2019s keep. To reach an enemy\u2019s keep, players must launch what is essentially the seed of a new structure, which will sprout into a new building upon landing and erect a wall connecting the new tower to the building that launched it. Each structure boasts its own capabilities, such as constructing other specific buildings, or spawning particular units. \n\nPlayers can decide to either quickly attack an opponent\u2019s base, adopt a more defensive strategy by fortifying their own headquarters or maintain a balance of offence and defence. Strategies are influenced by which of the two sides in the conflict players select.",
