As the leader of an elite tactical unit, you are sent into volatile operations where chaos, fear, and uncertainty dominate every room you enter.\n\nThis tactical first-person shooter emphasizes methodical gameplay over raw firepower. Each mission challenges you to secure hostile locations, respond to unpredictable threats, and protect innocent lives under extreme pressure.

Following procedures, minimizing collateral damage, and making the right calls at the right moment will determine your mission rating and overall progression. Reckless choices may lead to success, but never without consequences.\n\nKey Features\n\n- Tactical FPS with a strong focus on realism and tension\n- High-stakes operations involving civilians, hostages, and suspects\n- Strategic room-clearing and multiple entry methods\n- Reactive AI with dynamic and unpredictable behavior\n- Performance-based ranking system influenced by your decisions\n- Semi-open environments offering different tactical approaches\n\nEvery mission is a test of professionalism.\n\nStay calm, stay precise, and remember\u2014when the door opens, you must be READY OR DIE.\n",
