Her purpose is to serve in the lowest caste for the prosperity of Saturn, but B0B0 doesn't quite agree to that. Amidst a revolution against the Saturnian Satellites, the ultimate form of law, B0B0 hears news of a newfound music robot that'll fit right in her illegal band as a drummer. Rebelling against the corrupt system using music is the only thing she knows how to do well and she only needed a drummer to join her pack of misfits. With every piece in place, she's out to break some laws, and discover the truth behind the essence of music: the Keylocker.\n\nChoose Your Path as a cyberpunk rebel, where each class has its own unique skill tree and storyline.\n\nControl Electricity with your own music!
