	"description": "Don't be fooled by its cute charm! The journey home won't be an easy one!\n\nWindswept is a love letter to a period of gaming where collectathon platformers reigned supreme, trying again was the norm, and players only had a game manual to guide them.\n\nThere are over 40 stages to explore, each with their own set of hidden collectibles, bonus challenges and quirky obstacles to overcome... or fall victim to!\n\nYou'll learn every ability in the first stage of the game, after that you're on your own!\n\nChanging your leader gives you an entirely new set of actions to use and master - remember to take your time and things will click eventually...\n\nMaking your way home will be tough, and you'll need to keep trying until you get the hang of things - but for those who find it a walk in the park, there's plenty of hidden challenges along the way to test you!\n\nThere's no wrong way to play Windswept.\nMarbles and Checkers each have unique abilities, but that won't always be enough to overcome specialised challenges... Mix 'n' match different techniques to play your own way.\n\nYou may surprise yourself with what you're capable of!\nThe journey home is a long one - live for the moments as they happen.\n\nAfter that, they're only a memory!\nHow far will you go?\nWhere will your journey end?\nLet's get swept away - together!",
