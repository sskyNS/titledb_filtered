	"description": "Castle Springbottom is under attack! It's up to the Roundguard to save the king and -- more importantly -- recover his gold! Fling your hero into the face of danger and bounce off hordes of dangerously cute monsters to reach the bottom of the dungeon. With only one life, you'll need to learn how to navigate hazards, make strategic choices, and master your hero's skills if you hope to defeat the final boss. But don't worry, the Roundguard always bounces back!\n\n\u2022 Bouncy Fun: Intuitive pinball-physics-based gameplay like no other dungeon crawler.\n\u2022 Multiple Classes: Play as the Warrior, the Rogue, or the Wizard, each with their own unique skills, items, and cheeky sense of humour.\n\u2022 Randomised Dungeon: Each time you play, levels are procedurally generated, and quest events and elite monsters are randomly placed.\n\u2022 Permadeath with Benefits: When you die, you\u2019ll have a chance to bring a special trinket with you on your next run. The more gold you grab, the better your chances to collect one of the most powerful trinkets.\n\u2022 A Cast of Oddballs: Chat with the castle\u2019s colourful cast to pick up quests and learn why some rats want their king dead, what\u2019s irritating the local teenage skeleton today, or what the Warrior will do if you can\u2019t get to a bathroom quickly enough.\n\u2022 Lots of Loot: Over 100 items and trinkets, each with effects that present strategic choices and combo possibilities.\n\u2022 Show Off Your Skills: Compete on the leaderboards and try to master all the challenging, rule-bending relics.",
