	"description": "This game is a role-playing game released by Crystal Soft in Japan in 1984. Players take on the role of a hero cast into the Mugen Realm\u2014a place neither heaven nor hell\u2014on a quest to find the \"Mugen no Shinzou\" and escape. The adventure has a time limit, and the game ends if you exceed 30,000 in-game days.\n\nThe game alternates between a top-down view for field exploration and a first-person perspective in dungeons, where random encounters trigger battles with monsters, played out in a turn-based command selection format.\n\nIn addition to the time limit, progress in the adventure is paused rather than saved, making it relatively challenging. At the time, this game was known as a serious RPG, and it\u2019s a recommended pick for anyone looking for a classic, rewarding retro RPG experience.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
