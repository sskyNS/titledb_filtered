Magic Sheep is a charming, slow-paced puzzle adventure where you push wooden barrels across peaceful gardens until each one rests perfectly on a marble pedestal. No pressure, no timer, only soft music, gentle thinking, and plenty of \u201coh, that was clever\u201d moments.\n\nEach level is a tiny diorama built with love. You study the layout, plan a clean path, slide through narrow passages, avoid blocking yourself, and decide the perfect order to move each barrel. If something goes wrong, no worries at all. Undo takes you back one step, Restart lets you rethink the whole puzzle, and the atmosphere stays quiet and comforting from start to finish.\n\nAcross 30 handcrafted stages set between two biomes, the bright Summer and the cozy Autumn, you\u2019ll enjoy warm colors, relaxing scenery, and puzzles that grow more satisfying as you progress. Finishing a level fills the screen with a cheerful little jingle, rewarding your clever route and inviting you to the next peaceful challenge.\n\nMagic Sheep is perfect for players who love cozy visuals, gentle strategy, and the joy of solving puzzles at their own pace, all in the company of the happiest sheep in a top hat.",
