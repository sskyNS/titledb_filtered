	"intro": "Mable & The Wood is a Metroidvania where you can take the form of the bosses that you kill, changing how you're able to explore the interconnected world. ",
	"description": " It's also a Metroidvania where you don't have to kill anyone.\n\nThe strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...\n\nWhen the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone.\n\nWill you banish the darkness, or will you become it?\n\nCOMBAT IS MOVEMENT\n\nThe way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.\n\nYou can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.\n\nHUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE\n\nDefeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa, spider and more...\n\nFind and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!\n\nEXPLORE A DYING WORLD\n\nThe game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to discover.\n\nUncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)\n\nDISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE\n\nDiscover a rich story and define your own role in it. Will you become the saviour everyone's trying to convince you to be, or will your actions lead to the world literally tearing itself apart?",
