Our heroes' mission will be to regain control of the castle by ending its curse and bringing peace to the kingdom.\n\nThe game has been created with a total of 6 levels divided into three different biomes, each with its own aesthetics and challenges. All levels are made up of a single boss and a procedurally generated dungeon, full of real-time battles, being able to switch instantly between the four protagonists and in this way get the most out of their different abilities.",
