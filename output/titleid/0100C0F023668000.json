	"description": "Superation is a challenging boxing rogue-like that combines a precise fast-paced boxing combat with the replayability and unlockables that rogue-likes offer in a 9 bosses boss-rush, all while\u00a0exploring the self improvement philosophy.\n\nFight the Einherjar, your siblings and your own father to get your place among the Aesir\n\nYou are Thoridar, the weak bastard child of Thor and a Jotunn. He banished you into Jotunheim and forbid you to live among the Aesir because of your weakness. Prove him wrong using your fist and the blessings of the Aesir pantheon while growing stronger using the Wyrdforge\n\nRelax on Jotunheim\nUpgrade your punches with the help of V\u00f6lundr, a Jotunn that can touch the wyrd using his Wyrdforge and help you shape your destiny; and discover what the runes foretold with the help of the Norns Verdandi, Urd and Skuld. And you might even get some visit in there once in a while\n\nUnleash your rage\nThe Aesir consider you one of them and have your back! Get the blessings of Freyja, Baldr, Loki, the Allfather Odin and many more to enhance your punches or get you special abilities. There are thousands of combinations to discover, progress through the fights and complete challenges to unlock new blessings from them or the runes\n\nBuild for replayability\nA more challenging path awaits you in The Path of the Aesir: Tune in the challenges to fit you and beware of the great power of the bosses. Use the Wyrdforge to grow permanently stronger and give yourself more chances to defeat them.\n\nThe Aesir blood flows through you\nPermanent upgrades mean you don't have to be an Aesir yourself to experience the exciting and precise combat. But if you happen to be one, The Path of the Aesir awaits you\n\nWhat are you waiting for, Midgardian?",
