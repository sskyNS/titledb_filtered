	"description": "FEATURES:\n\u25aa Can\u2019t run from the past - explore the dark memories of a twisted old woman.\n\u25aa Dream logic - procedurally generated elements will keep you on your toes even on multiple playthroughs.\n\u25aa Handle the candle - explore beautifully frightening, dark levels, basked only in candlelight.\n\u25aa Face the music - let the amazing sound design immerse you in the nightmare.\n\u25aa Use your head - crack the complex puzzles and investigate the past of Henrietta Kedward.\n\nGet thrown into a living nightmare and explore the past of Henrietta Kedward in this terrifying and ever-changing survival horror filled with bone-chilling visuals.\n\nProject Nightmares is a group of scientists who dedicated themselves to studying the paranormal. As the regular means of analysis proved too limited to properly investigate the nature of these extra-natural phenomena, they devised a new means of examination. Using a device of their design, they are able to induce telepathically-gifted patients into a dream state, and connect their minds to a cursed or malignant object, allowing them to investigate their history and put a stop to the evil they embody. You are one of those patients.\n\nIn the first installment of the game, you will play through the case of Henrietta Kedward. You\u2019ll be able to connect with this malicious old woman through a malignant toy with a dark past and soon you\u2019ll find yourself in a nightmare set during her lifetime, surrounded by terror and mystery.\n\nWhen inside the nightmare, you\u2019ll never know what\u2019s going to happen next, even on multiple playthroughs as the game constantly shifts, taking advantage of its procedurally generated elements.",
