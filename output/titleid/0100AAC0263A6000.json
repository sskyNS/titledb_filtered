	"description": "Breathe in that fresh book smell. Book Shop Simulator puts you in charge of your very own cozy corner of literary heaven. Start with a single shelf, a few dusty paperbacks, and a dream big enough to fill the whole store. Buy stock, run the register, and charm customers into leaving with a bag full of stories.\n\nUpgrade your shelves, expand your selection, and create the perfect reading nooks where customers can lose hours between the pages. Whether you\u2019re selling hot-off-the-press bestsellers or quirky comics nobody saw coming, every sale brings you closer to bookstore glory.\n\nDecorate like a true book lover: plants in every corner, walls that tell their own stories. Still, nothing beats the smell of fresh pages and sweet, sweet profit\u2014except maybe catching a customer secretly sniffing the books.",
