No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.\n\nWith its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something new and disruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOT\u2019s polished, minimalist visual language helps you focus on what's most important \u2013 the fluid gameplay and the cinematic beauty of the fight.\n\nSUPERHOT features:\n\u2022 Endless Mode \u2013 how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies?\n\u2022 Challenge Mode \u2013 take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more.\n\u2022 Extras \u2013 delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted].\n\nThirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by its independent, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe.\n",
