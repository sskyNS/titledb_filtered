The fate of your Pikmin is yours to decide\u2014will you carefully avoid danger or rush into situations despite potential...losses?\n\nCreate your own explorer and navigate a big planet from a pint-sized perspective\n\nCustomize your look then embark on a journey to find and rescue fellow explorers. Traverse a world that seems larger than life as you see everyday objects like plants, benches, and pots tower over your explorer and Pikmin. Revisit these diverse areas at night and use brand-new Glow Pikmin to light the way forward...just watch out for berserk wildlife.\n\nGo explorer vs. explorer in Dandori Battles\n\nIn the world of the Pikmin\u2122 4 game, explorers like to get in on some friendly competition.

Gathering plenty of Pikmin to carry even more treasure is a key part of Dandori Battle strategy. You can also face off in Dandori Battles on the same system against a friend or family member, with more stages to play as the story progresses.\n\nIf a large group of Pikmin becomes a tasty treat for a hungry creature, use the Rewind Time feature to correct your mistake. Of course, this can also be used for less disastrous mistakes or to simply try a different approach. Get some extra help from another player who can toss pebbles at enemies and use items in the main campaign.\n\nYou get a space dog, too! Oatchi (pronounced oat-chee), resident good boy and dependable partner, can help with things like smashing obstacles and carrying you and your Pikmin throughout your adventure. With the miniscule Pikmin and a capable canine in tow, no challenge is too big!\n\nGive the adventure a try with a free Nintendo eShop demo!
