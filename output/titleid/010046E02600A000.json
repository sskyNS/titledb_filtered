	"description": "You\u2019re an indebted angler, trapped in a vicious cycle of borrowing and desperation. One dark, endless night at sea you haul up something unnatural: a talking fish named Cagliuso. It promises you riches \u2014 but its bargains come with terrifying strings.\nIn LOAN SHARK, the nets you cast bring more than fish. They pull you toward sacrifice, secrets, and a deadline you may never meet. The \u201cloan shark\u201d isn\u2019t just metaphoric\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something is stalking the waters, your time is running out, and every deal you strike pushes you deeper into the unknown.\"\n\u2022 Short, intense experience \u2013 Designed for a compact but unforgettable playthrough.\n\u2022 Underwater eye-cam mechanic \u2013 Watch the lure in submerged view, anticipate the bite, then pull fast while the depths watch you.\n\u2022 Fish & gut mechanic \u2013 After you reel them in, you must gut the fish yourself\u2026 carefully. Mistakes may cut you.\n\u2022 Surreal dialogues & meaningful choices \u2013 Meet Cagliuso and barter with a one-eyed talking fish. Every choice alters your path.\n\u2022 Time pressure & looming threat \u2013 The loan shark is coming. The clock ticks. Something hides in the darkness.\n\u2022 Atmospheric horror & creeping dread \u2013 The deep sea becomes your adversary; the familiar becomes monstrous.",
