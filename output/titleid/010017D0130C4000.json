	"description": "Destropolis is a top-down shooter game, inspired by such classic games like \u201cCrimsonland\u201d, \u201cAlien Shooter\u201d or \u201cNuclear Throne\u201d.\nIt takes place in a futuristic city, filled with red, cube-like enemies.

Shotguns, assault rifles and machine guns shoot bullets that shred your enemies to pieces. Missiles and nuclear launchers create balls of fire that effectively clear out battlefields. Lasers and gauss guns cut through the enemies like knives through butter.\n\u2022 12 power-ups and 40 skills that enhance your abilities. Place turrets, create force fields and detonate nuclear explosions. Increase your health, damage or movement speed.
