	"intro": "Aircraft Evolution is an action game, where you have the task of destroying enemy bases by bombarding them with your aircraft.",
	"description": "Fight through 4 time periods, from the era of the First World War to futuristic battles. \nLevel up and evolve your aircraft from a wooden plane to a futuristic fighter. Then, refine it by increasing its armor, fuel, speed, firepower and much more. You upgrade as you go, but you can still try to take on a tank armed with plasma cannons using just a wooden plane!\n\n40 different missions are waiting for you. You will be given different objectives: destroy an enemy base, deal with waves of attacking fighters, boss fights and much more. Demolish the enemy with standard bombs, a barrage of cluster bombs, or burn enemies to ashes with napalm. Turn their bases into smoldering ruins and the battlefield into a scorched desert.\nBombs and explosions! More bombs and explosions!!!",
