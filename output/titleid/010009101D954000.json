	"description": "Will you manage to completely destroy the wall until not a single brick is left standing?\n\nImmerse yourself in the most satisfying casual game where you tear down walls brick by brick using a circular saw! Push the bricks into your Bucket Crusher to convert them into cash, but watch out because you can run out of fuel!\n\nOnce you complete the first wall, there are various colorful and interesting mosaics with different shapes waiting for you to dig into and pull to pieces!\n \nUpgrade your machinery after each level and think carefully about the wisest way to invest your money. Increase the length, power, size, and fuel capacity to get more bricks with every run of the level!\n\nIf you want to knock down walls faster and earn more cash, consider buying special permanent upgrades that cost prestige points, but there's a catch here. To get them, you have to reset all your progress! \n\nFeatures:\n- tear down various brickwork mosaics using your saw!\n- earn coins for each brick you claim and reset your progress to get Prestige Points!\n- upgrade your machinery for more power, size, length, and fuel capacity\n- buy a variety of improvements: treadmill, tank, multiplier, discount, and servo!\n- change the look of your saw with different skins!\n- relax and de-stress after a long day\n- beware because the game is very addictive!",
