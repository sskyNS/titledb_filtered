	"intro": "In a world where water has run out, engineer Josephine falls victim to a corporation's schemes. Homeless, jobless, and robbed of a heart, what will she do?",
	"description": "Set long after humanity has polluted this planet, groundwater is undrinkable and seeing a living plant is considered a luxury. Most people live in megacities that rely on the labor of poor masses to sustain a modern standard of living for the few at the top. With the Earth scorched, water is liquid gold, and control of it is the truest form of power. Forced to cope with a permanent water shortage, ordinary people persist and toil in the hope that if they work hard enough, they too can someday swim every morning in the refreshing pools of the Gardens.\n\nWe follow the story of Josephine Lace, a young hydraulic engineer eager to climb the corporate ladder and claim a spot at the top. Until the day when that promising future is ripped away from her, leaving her half-dead and homeless, she becomes hellbent on taking down the system that ruined her and left her without a heart. Along the way she meets a diverse group of people sympathetic to her cause, every one with secrets of their own. With their help, perhaps she will find redemption, love, and most of all - vengeance.\n\nVENGEFUL HEART FEATURES:\n-Story rich in social commentary with both grim and humoristic undertones\n-Synthwave soundtrack that makes you nostalgic for the time that never was\n-Gorgeous art reminiscent of PC-98 with a personal touch\n-Story branches with wildly different outcomes",
