	"description": "\nChase the slippery bandit through a creaky old mansion filled with more traps than your grandma's attic. Jump, dodge, and maybe trip a little as you race to catch the most annoyingly agile criminal in London.\nFeeling clever? You could try to take a shortcut through the elevator \u2014 assuming it doesn\u2019t stop between floors for a dramatic pause.\nWill justice be served \u2014 or will he slip away with your dignity and the loot?",
