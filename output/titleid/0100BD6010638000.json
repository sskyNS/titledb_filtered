	"intro": "Stranded in space! Operate two walker\nrobots to repair your ship and get you home.",
	"description": "You\u2019re in deep space and something\u2019s collided with the ship. Main power is offline and you\u2019re trapped. It\u2019s lucky you have access to this terminal. It\u2019s a little old but with these two deck robots and some clever thinking you might be able to get power back online and save the day. \n\nTake control of two walker robots as you tackle 30 decks that include engineering, labortories and high security sectors. The robots cannot be operated at the same time so you have to alternate between them, figuring out how to use them as a team to make it through each deck. Switch between the walkers at any time and make use of switches, lifts, bombs, energy beams and teleports as you aim to restore power, reactivate the life support and solve the mystery of the collision. An unknown voice on the other end of the terminal is your only guide.",
