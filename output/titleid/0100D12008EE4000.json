	"description": "Heart&Slash is a 3D brawler roguelike robot love story set in a world where machines are all that remains from human civilization. \n\nYou play as Heart, a sentient robot fighting to escape the grip of the evil and all-seeing machine QuAsSy (Quality Assurance Systems). But make no mistake, Heart&Slash is no walk in the park. Every death is permanent and means a new randomly generated level for you to start over with a different set of weapons and items you can use, new enemies to fight and secrets to explore. Heart&Slash offers players something new and challenging because it is not about mastering one system, rather adapting to what is provided and making the most of it.",
