	"description": "Watt and Volt are two twin robots, who have been forgotten by time and abandoned in an old robot factory. Marked as defective by mistake, if they wish to prove themselves as deserving a place in today\u2019s world, they must pass a series of grueling tests.\n\nWatt and Volt will have their work cut out for them, but the good news is you might not have to go it alone as although both robots can be controlled at any moment due to swapping between them, co-op is fully supported, so as long as you have a friend to control the other robot, the only thing you\u2019ll need to focus on, is what your own robot is doing.\n\nFeatures: \n\u2022 Strategic Thinking\n\u2022 Fast Reflexes\n\u2022 Exploring, find the secret areas!\n\u2022 Puzzle Solving\n\u2022 Achievements",
