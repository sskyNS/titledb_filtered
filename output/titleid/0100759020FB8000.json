Take part in a magical tale that combines classic platforming with puppet-inspired gameplay, in a captivating story of friendship, self-discovery, and redemption.\n\nWear the glove of Nieve, a Stagehand exiled to the Understage, and wield control over Drev\u2019s strings, a Puppet magically bound to her. As they journey to return to the Frontstage above, they will retell forgotten stories, uncover shadowy secrets, and learn their fate is interwoven with the kingdom of theater itself.\n\nHighlights:\nBecome Puppet and Puppeteer: Pull the strings and master the art of puppetry in this unique approach to action, movement, and creative puzzle-solving. \nA Troupe of Characters: Meet an ensemble cast of dozens of Major and supporting characters, featuring hundreds of lines of handcrafted dialogue. \nDeadly Shadows: Face a horde of villainous creatures who will do all they can to snuff out the lights and bring the show to an untimely end. \nA Meticulously Crafted World: Marvel at the stylized and detailed graphics that reinforce the magic of theater, with stages that fluctuate between past and present. \nSet The Scene: Arrange and move props, backdrops and characters to rebuild theatrical stages, and re-enact scenes to unveil what befell the once proud World Stage. \nEnchanting Soundscapes: Be captivated by a rich, theatrical soundtrack and immersive sound effects that bring the world of Once Upon a Puppet to life...\n\n\nThe Leading Actors:\nUnwittingly bound together by spool and thread, Drev and Nieve reluctantly embark on a quest to reclaim their place in the theater, against a heartbroken King.\n\nNieve, a talented Weaver beset by self doubt, builds a strong bond with Drev, a naive yet ambitious Actor. With Drev's unbridled theatrics and Nieve's brilliance, they will conquer their deepest held fears to reveal the truth of the void harbored in their hearts.\n\n",
