A unique strategy roguelike based on the timeless checkboard classic.\nYou are the Black King but all your army has gone over to the white side, leaving you with nothing but your royal shotgun and your wounded pride.\n\nIt's time to teach those white pieces to fear the Shotgun King.\n\nKey Features:\n- Choose wisely: Every turn, you may either move your king or shoot at enemy pieces, after what you'll need to move again to reload your shotgun.\n- Avoid Checkmate: Kill the White King to complete the floor and move on to the next level!\n- Strengthen both Kings: After completing each floor, you will upgrade your king... but also your opponent!\n- A whole kingdom: 15 difficulty ranks, an endless mode, a chase mode, and over 100 upgrades are waiting for you!",
