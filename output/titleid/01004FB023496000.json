	"description": "Strap in and take control of a futuristic hover ship hurtling through an infinite cylindrical track. In Hover Runners, you don\u2019t steer the ship \u2014 you rotate the world around it. Dodge deadly obstacles like blocks and laser fences, zip through glowing tunnels, and ride speed boosts as your velocity climbs to insane levels.\n\nCollect shimmering gems along the way to unlock 7 unique ships, each with their own sleek design. Every second you survive, the pace ramps up \u2014 testing your reflexes, focus, and nerves of steel. How far can you make it before the track wins?\n\nThe gameplay is fast-paced and endlessly replayable, with a unique rotation mechanic that keeps every run intense. With dynamic obstacles, unlockables, and a simple control scheme, Hover Runners is perfect for quick bursts or extended sessions. It\u2019ll keep you coming back for just one more run.",
