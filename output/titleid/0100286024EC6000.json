	"description": "This is a racing game released in Japan by Carry Lab in 1987. Players become racers, taking their crimson cars onto six courses: MEGACITY, PLATEAU, ALPS, ISLAND, EGYPTIAN, and CANYON.\n\nA classic racing title, it features no items, just brake, accelerator, and steering. Players race to the finish, dodging endless cars. Puddles and oil slicks on the track mean slight errors can cause a crash, ensuring constant tension.\n\nThe game also boasts beautiful backgrounds across all six courses, shifting from day to evening to night as the race progresses.\n \n *This application does not have a scene select mode.\n *The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n *Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
