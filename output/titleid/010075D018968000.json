	"description": "Greek Tragedy is a retro-styled indie survival horror game with puzzle elements. Help Amy keep her life on the college campus overrun by cultists and maybe save her relationship in the process. Nostalgic 90s 3D aesthetics included.\n\nSTORY:\nWhile immersing herself deeply in her creative writing, Amy Chipley suddenly gets an urgent message from Kurt, her boyfriend. The cryptic e-mail implores her to meet up with him at the Student Union Building, and suggests immediate danger.\n\nLocked in the common room with strange, foul-smelling gas seeping in, Amy must do her best to find a way out quickly, else she perishes at the hands of a bloodthirsty cult. Why are there cameras in the dorm rooms? What do these robed fraternity brothers want? And how do ancient gemstones fit into all of this?\n\nInvestigate the conspiracy and uncover secrets behind a recent wave of disappearances, rescue Kurt and expose the truth behind it all, or get the hell out as quickly as possible. You\u2019ve still got student loans to pay, after all.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Cinematic student-horror experience\n- Non-linear puzzles\n- Callback to classic survival horror titles\n- Deep secrets to uncover",
