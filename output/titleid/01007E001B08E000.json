	"description": "Play as the youngest member of the illustrious, magical von Teasel family, but you\u2019re not exactly their pride and joy. In fact, your grandmother has given you one last chance to prove yourself \u2014 or no more witch training for you!\n\nYou arrive in the small village of Flora, along with your familiar, Ramsey. You have two weeks to help the locals prepare their harvest festival for success, and prove your worth to, well, everyone. But don\u2019t worry! That\u2019s plenty of time to plan a village festival and make some (questionable) life choices! \n\nBE YOUR OWN WITCH\nDesign your troublesome witch however you see fit, with a ton of customization options. There\u2019s no excuse for not looking your best!\n\nGATHER HERBS & BREW POTIONS\nTend your garden to collect plants to use in your magical recipes, as well as other rituals and experiments that are totally, definitely Official Witch Business.\n\nBEWITCH THE LOCALS\nGet to know the charming residents of Flora including three romance-able characters. Will you end up with a date for the festival?\n\nLIVE YOUR BEST WITCHY LIFE\nCraft spells, perform tarot readings, lead guided meditations and more. Maybe you\u2019ll throw in an extra rune or two for more potency. And if anything backfires, you can hide from the world and decorate your altar. ",
