	"description": "Smashy Cannon is a fast-paced endless challenge where precision and timing are everything. Control the angle of your cannon and fire bullets to smash targets that rise from the ocean across scattered islands. Each wave gives you a limited number of shots to clear all targets before facing off in a boss stage\u2014an intense sequence of targets that will test your aim under pressure. Chain together successful hits to trigger Frenzy mode, where your cannon fires nonstop for a short burst, letting you tear through targets at lightning speed. But be careful\u2014outside of Frenzy, hitting a bad target means instant game over. As you progress, some targets begin to move, adding an extra layer of difficulty. Simple to pick up but hard to master, Smashy Cannon is all about rhythm, accuracy, and staying cool under fire.",
