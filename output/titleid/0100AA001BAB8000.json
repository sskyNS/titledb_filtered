	"description": "Fresh Start is a relaxing single player game, in which you embark on a mission to clean up the world and restore nature to its fresh and colorful shape. Watch as the world changes in front of your eyes as you help animals, solve puzzles and grow plants around you.\n\nTravel all over the world and give it a Fresh Start it deserves!\n\nSAVE THE WORLD AROUND YOU!\nA wonderful machine has been put into your hands - a combination of a vacuum cleaner and a watering hose! While traveling the world, you\u2019ll be able to wash away piles of mud and dirt from the surface of the earth. All vacuumed up and collected rubbish can then be recycled into valuable experience points.\n\nGROW YOUR SKILLS!\nAs you gather experience from restoring the world, you can choose to spend them on a variety of upgrades from the skill shop. Your hard earned experience points can be put to use to make your work more efficient.\n\nWATER THE DRIED-UP PLANTS AND BRING BACK THEIR BEAUTY\nUse the power of water to bring dry and dead plants back to life. Spray the ones that are just sprouting to help them bloom in full force! Remember - it\u2019s not just plants that need water to get back to life!\n\nHELP OTHERS AND MAKE FRIENDS!\nAs you travel around the world you\u2019re going to meet some cute, unique friends in need! Use your skills to bring comfort and happiness back into their lives and you will quickly gain their gratitude and friendship.\n\nSEARCH FOR MYSTERIOUS ITEMS AND SOLVE PUZZLES\nIt\u2019s not as simple as you think - apart from cleaning the world, there are quests waiting for you in each place your journey takes you to. Find puzzle elements and mechanism pieces hidden throughout the maps to fix your travel vehicles. Gather food dispensers to feed hungry animals. Uncover shrines, campsites and more as you travel and help nature all around the globe!",
