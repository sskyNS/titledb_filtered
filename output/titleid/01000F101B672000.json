	"description": "The Stone of Madness is a real-time tactical stealth game set in an 18th-century Spanish Monastery. Located in the Pyrenees, this time-worn Jesuit monastery is home to a madhouse and an inquisitorial prison. Five prisoners - plagued by cruel punishment, madness, and despair - pool their skills and resources to face their phobias, stave off insanity, uncover the mysteries of the Monastery, and find a way to escape.\n\nEscape the Monastery\nEscaping such a well-guarded monastery is no easy task, but Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo are determined to see it through. Alternate control of all five characters and use their unique upgradable skills to cast spells, assassinate targets, distract enemies, stun evil spirits, explore hard-to-reach areas, and more. \n\nExplore your surroundings and combine the characters\u2019 abilities to find clues and tools scattered throughout the monastery. Be careful though, if you\u2019re caught being somewhere you shouldn\u2019t be, the guards will not be kind.\n\nManage the Madness\nTo effectively navigate the monastery, you must be mindful of the characters' mental health.\n\nEach playable character possesses a fully realized set of traumas and phobias. Triggering these traits depletes a character\u2019s sanity, ultimately triggering a traumatic event with negative effects such as paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence; fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played.\n\nDiscover the Secrets Within\nChoose from two different escape plans to execute, each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises. \n\nTime is continuous in The Stone of Madness. Actions have consequences, and players must consider their time of day as they make decisions.\n \nSneaking, exploring, and gathering materials are all ideal tasks to complete during the day when security guards are easily distracted. But as morning gives way to evening, the paranormal inhabitants of the Monastery will start to reveal themselves; posing a threat to the characters\u2019 sanity.\n \nNighttime is most wisely spent planning and managing the escape plan. Any player who explores the monastery after curfew will be met with an extra challenge. Security is tighter, and guards will not take kindly to any prisoners wandering about. But sometimes, the risk is worth the reward. \n\nExperience a Stunning Hand-Painted Art Style\n\nThe visuals in The Stone of Madness have been lovingly hand-painted and animated frame by frame, drawing heavy inspiration from 18th-century artist Francisco De Goya.\n\nThe game's isometric perspective acts as the perfect showcase for the eye-catching visuals, allowing players to observe every minute detail and feel as if they\u2019re adventuring through a Goya painting brought to life.\n",
