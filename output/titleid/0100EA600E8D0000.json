	"description": "DEAD SECRET CIRCLE is designed by hardcore fans of classic horror games. If you like exploring creepy places, discovering a complex story, solving weird puzzles, and running for your life from a straight-razor-wielding serial killer with a sinister laugh, DEAD SECRET CIRCLE is for you.\n\nDEAD SECRET CIRCLE is a horror mystery game set in 1971 Chicago and the sequel to the critically acclaimed DEAD SECRET.\n\nFive years after the events of DEAD SECRET, Patricia Gable's investigation of a serial killer leads her to a condemned apartment building in East Chicago. There she finds people living on the margins of society, too poor or too stubborn to leave, each with something to hide. The building nearly vibrates with secrets. And strangely, Patricia feels like she's been there before.\n\nWhat To Expect\n\u2022 A creepy whodunit with a story that goes deep. Meet seven strange suspects, each with something to hide. There's a serial killer on the loose, and they know more than they are letting on.\n\u2022 Delve into their lives to name the killer and discover the truth.\n\u2022 Slow-burn psychological horror. Nothing is as it seems.\n\u2022 You can run, you can hide, but you cannot fight The Laughing Man. Your only weapon is your wits.\n\u2022 Comb the environment for clues. In DEAD SECRET CIRCLE you can freely explore every nook and cranny of the highly detailed environment with standard first-person controls.\n\u2022 Solve devious puzzles in classic Adventure format. Collect items, review the clues, and unlock the secrets of this strange building.\n\u2022 A haunting original soundtrack by Ben Prunty (FTL, Darkside Detective, Into the Breach).\n\u2022 Multiple endings, a huge collection of hidden items and documents, and branching dialog paths.",
