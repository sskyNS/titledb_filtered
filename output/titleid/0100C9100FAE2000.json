Easy to learn, hard to master!\n- Autosaving. Don't worry about any losing any progress\n\nNonograms?\nNonograms are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid are filled in by following the number hints provided on the top and side of the grid. Once all the hints are filled in, a secret image reveals itself!\n\nHaven't I seen this before? \nYou may have! Nonograms have been around for quite some time. You may also know them as Hanjie, Pic-a-Pix, Paint by Numbers, or Griddlers. However, we have a secret twist to our puzzles! Unlike traditional games which limit your puzzle to one grid, our puzzles consist of 3 layers. As a portion of each layer is colored in, the final image will begin to form based on how all 3 layers blend together. Ensure each layer is correct, and you'll reveal the final image and solve the puzzle!\n\n",
