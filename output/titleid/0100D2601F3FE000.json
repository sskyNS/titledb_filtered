	"intro": "In this book-based puzzler, a captivating tale unfolds before you. Its narration blends seamlessly with the conundrums and riddles you must face.",
	"description": "49 Keys is a narrative-focused game that will test your wits and nerves. Peruse the pages of a Lovecraftian tale, interact with maps and solve the puzzles encountered along the way. Trace your master's footsteps to uncover the deepest secrets of the arcane, on a quest brimming with horror and magic.\n\n\nEmbark on a Disturbing Journey\nAlas, I knew not of the extraordinary, bizarre, and gut-churning sights that awaited within those walls.\n\nThe year is 1520. You receive a letter from your old mentor, the first step on an unnerving journey like none before. One that shall expose you to the forbidden arcane and all its mystery in which you shall concoct mixtures both wondrous and strange, and summon forth beings of other-worldly power. You must steel yourself, for terrors buried deep within shall soon awaken within you, Dantean horrors that bleed into reality. Endure these trials and, in time, the truth shall draw near. Yet will you be brave enough to pay its price?\n\nAn Immersive Literary Feat\nIts lauded writing aside, 49 Keys is an audio-visual work of art. Intricately-designed menus hark back to manuscripts of the Middle Ages through to the Renaissance, with a unique art style throughout. Pore over incredible full-colour illustrations, and feel the thrill as original themes perfectly complement each twist and turn. All this combines for a deeply immersive world.\n\nUnique Riddles and Marvellous Mysteries\nAkin to point-and-click adventures, 49 Keys has you search through a meticulously-crafted world collecting items to aid you in solving its myriad puzzles. Read every word with care, for vital clues are hidden within. Put your reasoning skills to the test, and push onward; but fear not\u2014an array of detailed in-game tips are at hand, if ever you need them.\n\nDirectly Adapted From The Best-Seller\n49 Keys was developed and adapted by the original author behind the 2022 gamebook of the same name (49 Chiavi), a best-selling puzzle adventure. Gaining overwhelming praise from critics, it also achieved a place on Italy's 2022 gamebook best-seller list, going on to win two highly-coveted awards that year.",
