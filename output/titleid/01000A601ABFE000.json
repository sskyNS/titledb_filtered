	"description": "On a journey through 8 Kingdoms. It will be a journey of great adventures, suspense, terror, joy, comedy, humor, battles, drama.\n\n-Some elements of Zodiakalik:\n\n* Enemies are fully visible on the battlefield. Yes! Forget the hassles of random battles! In Zodiakalik, you choose whether to battle or not!\n\n-EDD system:\n\n* The EDD system (Enemies Don't Die) provides something new: enemies, even after being defeated, remain on the map. But don't worry, they have a delay of more than 1 second, enabling a safe escape. This method is great for training!\n\n-Almost 40 new songs!\n\n* Almost 40 songs made by me. Enjoy a wide selection of tracks and styles.\n\n-Too much to search!\n\n* Search each corner. It is not known what will be found out there!\n\n-Powerful bosses!\n\n* Imposing and challenging bosses. Try not to train or use worse equipment to increase the challenge.\n\n-Fully 3D and different camera angles!\n\n* Zodiakalik presents a fully 3D world! Change the camera angles and enjoy the beauty of this world. Also, there is a First-Person view (FP Mode).\n\n-Various charismatic NPCs!\n\nSeveral characters await you, in different ways, on this adventure.\n\n-Many items to collect!\n\nLet's get everything!\n\nWelcome to your adventure! Zodiakalik!",
