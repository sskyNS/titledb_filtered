	"description": "Classic survival horror comes to Nintendo Switch! Solve puzzles and face sinister enemies in deadly combat at home with your console docked \u2013 or on the go in handheld mode. \nPlay as Caroline Walker as she hunts for missing twin girls in a cavernous abandoned mansion. Can you confront your fears and uncover the secrets of Winterlake... or will you die trying?\n\nSomething Evil Lurks at Winterlake\nWhile investigating the disappearance of twin girls at Winterlake, something terrible happens to Caroline Walker. Waking in the dead of night, naked and hooked up to some kind of outdated medical equipment in a bathtub, Caroline must fight for her life as she explores the halls of the abandoned mansion.\n\nA Return to Classic Survival Horror\nA modern take on the fixed-perspective action-adventure game, it offers a modernised control scheme and dynamic camera combined with classic gameplay.\n\nDeadly Combat\nDark forces and unspeakable horrors will do everything in their power to stop Caroline getting to the truth. Use anything and everything that you can find to fight back against evils lurking in the darkness.\n\nKeep Your Wits About You\nYou'll need much more than a steady aim and sharp reflexes to make it out alive. Search the environment for anything you can use to your advantage. Combine items to solve twisted puzzles and use every resource available to explore the secrets of the mansion and its grounds.\n\nFiendish Puzzles\nScavenge essential resources and tools, decipher clues from long-forgotten journals, and combine it all to solve fiendish puzzles and get to the bottom of the mansion's sordid history.\n\n\nGateways to Another Dimension\nNothing is quite as it seems at Winterlake. Mirrors provide a path to an alternate reality and another place in time. By crossing these shimmering gateways, Caroline can manipulate the very fabric of reality in surprising ways.\n\nYou Are Not Alone in the Dark\nThe mansion may seem abandoned, but as Caroline investigates its secrets, dark forces and unspeakable horrors will do everything in their power to stop her getting to the truth. Be sure to be alert at all times, and use anything you can find to fight off the encroaching terrors of Winterlake. Just remember: gaze into the darkness, and it also gazes into you...\n\nCan Caroline Walker escape with the truth and escape with her life?",
