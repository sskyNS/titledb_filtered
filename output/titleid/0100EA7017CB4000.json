Therefore, the game consists of 9 huge areas, each representing one circle of hell. In each area the player has to find a certain number of soul crystals in order to open the portal to the next level and to advance one circle. \n\nThe game is a uniquely stylized 3d first-person platformer and plays around with the concept of live and death.\nEach circle consists of 5 different platforming challenges and surprises with breathtaking environments, a surreal world full of beauty, grace and despair, and a couple of small environmental puzzles that blend perfectly into the peaceful yet stunning environments. \n\nWill you be able to escape hell?\nFind it out.",
