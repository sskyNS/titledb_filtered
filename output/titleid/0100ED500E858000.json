	"description": "Mike is a decent man. An ordinary one, you might say. But he is no pushover when it comes to capturing the enchanted hat from his nemesis, Divider. You see, Divider\u2019s hat changes everything, including the position and direction of the screen. Mike\u2019s only hope is to collect the cursed keys, and catch Divider through different locations and traps. Portions of his world will swap, turn and even flip to give him one unique adventure.\n\nSwaps and Traps is a fun game, which will challenge your platformer skills as well as your eyes and necks. As you collect a key in a scene, you also trigger the main trap of the game. Portions of your screen will swap, turn and even flip horizontally and vertically to give you one unique adventure.\n\nSwaps and Traps has a retro vibe, with simple gameplay against high level difficulty.\n- 3 Worlds: Let\u2019s Jungle, Night Watch and Divider\u2019s Den\n- 100+ levels\n- Insane bonus levels\n- Playful music\n- 100+ achievements\n- An adventure to remember\n\nReady to get lost in a single screen?",
