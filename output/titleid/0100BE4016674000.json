	"description": "Time Loader is a story-driven, physics-based puzzle platformer with a twist. At the helm of a small robot, you\u2019ll travel back to the 90s to prevent a tragic accident. Explore the house of your creator, solve brain-teasing puzzles, acquire unique and powerful upgrades, and see common household items from an entirely new perspective!\n\nBut remember: meddling with time has serious consequences. You may succeed in changing the past, but can you deal with the result of your actions?\n\nGameplay Features:\nSubverted perspectives\nEven the most familiar objects look different when you\u2019re the size of a toy car. Will you watch your every move or dive head-first into this dangerous new world?\n\nAn arsenal to choose from\nBoosters, harpoons, screwdrivers\u2026 choose among dozens of upgrades to tackle each level and get the job done!\n\nDynamic and branching narratives\nDon\u2019t just relive the past: change it! Every choice you make will influence the story and may lead to a different outcome. So do us a favor: change the past responsibly!\n\nA complimentary dose of nostalgia\nTime Loader features music, references, and items straight out of the \u201890s. Relive your childhood or, if you\u2019re too young for it, just gawk in awe at how primitive humanity used to be back then!",
