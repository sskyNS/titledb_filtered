	"intro": "A hand-painted puzzle adventure game set inside Monet\u2019s eye",
	"description": "Explore the eye of master artist Claude Monet and experience a unique biographical adventure! Test your skills and perseverance as you overcome the progressive disease that threatened Monet\u2019s eyesight and solve puzzles to help the painter complete some of his greatest masterpieces.\n\nAbout the Game:\nThe Master\u2019s Pupil is a puzzle adventure where you will travel across the iris of Claude Monet and help him complete his masterpieces.\n\nThroughout the game, you will encounter and overcome increasing challenges as Monet experiences loss, like the passing of his wife Camille, and struggles with the cataracts that threatened his art making. Consider color, space, and physics as you traverse the world of his eye - as one wrong color combination or move can end your journey.\n\nKey Features:\nHand Painted and expertly crafted - almost every part of this game has been painstakingly made using a real paintbrush in real life before being imported to the world. The results are unique visuals reminiscent of Monet\u2019s Impressionism that change and adapt over his lifetime.\nA Biographical Adventure - experience a life\u2019s story in a way that has never been done before. No language or text describes the man or his actions, instead navigate intricate landscapes based on Monet\u2019s real paintings, and journey through a unique rich soundscape. All matched with an emotional and moving score by indie composer Steven W Schouten.\nCalm and Relaxed - An artist doesn\u2019t rush but takes their time when completing their work. The Master\u2019s Pupil gives you time to consider each puzzle, with tests that will challenge your brain but not your reflexes.",
