But a race of elves known as the Sidhe resisted and were branded heretics. On the brink of losing the war, the Sidhe elders sacrificed themselves and the elven capital city to destroy the seven kings and their armies. As one of the few surviving elves, you embark on a quest for vengeance against those who slaughtered your friends, family, and entire race.\n\nHeretic: Faith Renewed [NEW]\nYears after the planes were cleansed of D'Sparil's wretched influence, a wandering warrior in search of home arrives at a foreign land to discover the blighted stains of that old time religion seeping through the cracks of society once more. In the fortified city, zealous acolytes stand high atop a decadent cathedral and listen to the lamentations echoing from the streets as non-believers are dragged away for 'correction.' The shadow of D'Sparil lingers after death, his absence attributed to apotheosis. Once revered, now worshipped, deserving of neither. An all-too-familiar scene, and one you simply cannot stomach. Taking up the mantle of Heretic once more, you stride into the city, staff in hand, to silence the echoes of your arch-nemesis.\n\nHexen: Beyond Heretic\nWhile the Sidhe elf Corvus battled the evil forces of D'Sparil, the remaining two Serpent Riders were busy sowing the seeds of destruction in other dimensions. As a Warrior, Mage, or Cleric, you must fight the undead and brave elemental dungeons and decaying wilderness to defend your realm of Cronos from Korax, the second Serpent Rider.\n\nHexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel\nAfter defeating the evil Korax, the second Serpent Rider, and discovering the Chaos Sphere, you have been transported to the Realm of the Dead. Now your only way home is blocked by hordes of undead and the Dark Citadel. Where Hexen ends, the true nightmare begins.\n\nHexen: Vestiges of Grandeur [NEW]\nKorax lingers between life and death, his shredded corpse left behind with no semblance of life while he clings to a fresh, if fragile, rebirth. His grip on Cronos is once more released, yet the cycle continues, proving another force is at work: an invisible hand puppeteering both Korax and you, weaving a star-crossed destiny that will never die. And if that hand tugs the threads of fate again, what surprises are yet in store for you?",
