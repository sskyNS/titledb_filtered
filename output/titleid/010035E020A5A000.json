	"description": "ABOUT\nWelcome to Ocean Keeper, a mining roguelike shooter with a top-down view. Play as a Miner whose spaceship has crashed on a planet, filled with underwater monsters. Find resources and artifacts for purchasing valuable upgrades. \n\nUse the time between each attack to power up your diver, mech, weapon or explore a new dungeon. Build automatic turrets, use drones to collect loot and improve your skills to increase your chances of survival.\n\nABYSSAL ASSAULTS\nDozens of weapons, upgrades, and monsters are waiting for you. The world here is dangerous, and keeps in unknown threats. \nYou should be very careful and survive as long as possible. Spider Mech, your faithful companion, is ready to help you with that. Mix different weapons to make your special setup, practice your combat and defense skills.\n\nDIVERSE BIOMES \nThe underwater world of Ocean Keeper consists of many biomes. You will have to travel through the locations and find the remains of a lost civilization. Discover mysterious locations, from abandoned sci-fi laboratories to mines with artifacts. EACH time you explore the underwater worlds, the layout changes, making every journey unique. You never play the same scenario twice.\n\nFARM RESOURCES\nDrill caves in search of different resources to upgrade your equipment, weapons and Mech Spider. It's worth saying that the local fauna didn't like the fact that you want to mine their sources! So don't forget to exit the dungeons, and switch to a dynamic combat mode.\n\nTry to keep a balance between Mech and Digger upgrades as your survival depends on the speed of resource mining. And who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and find unique treasures and artifacts. Some of them will help you to instantly improve your equipment and become as strong as possible.\n\nMASSIVE BOSS FIGHTS\nOcean Keeper is ready to surprise you by massive battles with unique bosses! From a giant crab to the flying mouse, each battle will be a true challenge. We won\u2019t reveal all the cards \u2014 there are many more. The other question is, will you have the strength to defeat them? However, don\u2019t be scared and bravely go through all the challenges \u2014 your courage will be awarded.\n\nREPLAYABILITY \nForget about monotony - each new game session will open new secrets of the underwater world, and battles with sea monsters will become harder. You can use various meta upgrades and unique types of Mechs to bravely fight with every wave of monsters.\n\nEven if after death the game starts from zero, you still can use all your resources and upgrade your equipment and weapon in the Hub. It will help you to dive again and become much stronger than before. \n\nAre you ready to test how far you can get? Will you reach the final boss in the game?\n",
