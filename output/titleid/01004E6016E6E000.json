All these things stack, so you have every opportunity to turn your furry warrior into a raging death machine.\n\nYou\u2019ll still die, though. That\u2019s just how life is, even for those who wield a rail gun. But who cares about death when your audience loves YOU? Unlike real life, here you can make good use of the likes you receive.\n\nUse your new-found fame to help upgrade every item and every perk to deal even more damage when you head out again. Oh, don\u2019t worry about getting bored: every episode of the show is randomized so you\u2019ll never have the same run twice in-a-row.\nAnd, when you are completely done with show business, invite your friends and party-up with co-op mode with up to four players! Play smart and synergize with the team or bash their teeth in when they will try to steal your power-ups: every dirty trick in the book is valid, and every strategy works as long as you are having fun.\n\nSo, are you ready to sign the contract?\nRogue-lite Shoot'em-up\nThere are tons of enemies, dozens of weapons, lots of perks and items, randomized drop and map layouts, as well as carnivorous bosses for you to test your ability to beat the game with in-game items\n\nThe most bizarre TV Show\nIt\u2019s cute. It\u2019s colorful. It\u2019s everything you love about old-school gore cartoons. This is your only opportunity to make a pink rabbit into a harbinger of death. Do not miss it!\n\nPlay solo or co-op\nPlay the game solo or get your friends to play with you, create elaborate tactics or mess around and try to steal your friend\u2019s items and power-ups. The goal is to have fun and get famous, not to sit down crunching numbers. Though it\u2019s also a thing if you are into it.",
