	"description": "Welcome to the Outlands! A faraway place where work is hard but rewarding, where people dream big but stay grounded, where friends become family, and settlements become cities.\n\nYou will follow the story of a cast of lovable, eccentric, and (mostly) well-intentioned town leaders, as they pursue their dreams and whims, while their paths slowly start to intertwine in surprising, often humorous, sometimes heart-warming ways. It\u2019s up to you to use the extensive catalog of tools and buildings at your disposal to guide them towards their goals.\n\nWhen challenges get too hard and the Outlanders start getting too picky, you can take a detour to the Sandbox mode, where creativity is the new leader in town. There, you can play with the full catalog of buildings and mechanics right off the bat and customize the maps and rules as you please.\n\nThe journey of Outlanders is only just beginning. As new leaders keep coming from far away to share their stories, and new ways of playing and sharing your experiences appear on the horizon, the ever-shifting landscape of possibilities gets more and more exciting.\n\nEverybody\u2019s coming to the Outlands!\nWill you join them?",
