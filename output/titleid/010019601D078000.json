	"description": "Soul Dog TD is a tower defense game where you fend off approaching enemies alongside Soul Dog and six other units. \n\nDefeat enemies invading from the left of the screen before they reach your leader, all while picking up the souls of fallen enemies to enhance your own units. Once you defeat the enemy, select one of three items according to the circumstances, bolstering your forces even further.\n\nThe controls are simple. You can get started playing right away--but beware! You'll soon find yourself hooked. Show off your command skills on all sorts of battlefields, from grasslands and forests to valleys and more!\n\n\u25a0 What is a \"Soul Dog\"?\nSoul Dog is capable of collecting the souls that appear once you've defeated enemies. You'll need these to enhance your forces, so be sure to collect them all. However, you'll need to get the timing just right as you'll be rendered defenseless while collecting them.\n\n\u25a0 Switch Between Two Modes to Battle\nYour forces are comprised of six units, each with an \"Attack Mode\" and a \"Training Mode\" that you can switch between.\n\n- Attack Mode\nAutomatically attacks enemies.\n\n- Training Mode\nGradually collects experience points and levels you up. Attacking is disabled.\n\nMasterfully switch between the two modes to increase your efficiency in battle. Determine how many units you'll need to attack the approaching enemies and switch the rest to training mode for maximum efficiency and a path to victory. May luck be on your side!",
