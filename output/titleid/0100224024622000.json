	"intro": "Psychopathy Assessment is a retro-90s V.H.S style analog horror game that blurs the line between reality and delusion. Step into a universe where you're not just playing a game; you're taking a psychopathy test, but the stakes are considerably higher than a straightforward diagnosis.\n\nAnswer a series of questions designed to probe your deepest thoughts and impulses.\n\nEvery choice has consequences, each more unsettling than the last, as the screen flickers and the tape warps under the weight of your decisions.\n\nAre you ready to find out if you're truly a psychopath? Or will the test itself drive you to madness? The only way to know is to press play.\n\nFeatures:\n\n-Psychopathy Test: Respond to a series of frightening and penetrating questions intended to delve into your psyche. Will the results show something sinister, or is this just a game?\n\n-Dynamic Consequences: Each decision has an impact on the atmosphere and your final ending, guaranteeing that no two playthroughs are identical.\n\n-Immersive VHS Filter: Play via a distorted lens, complete with realistic VHS effects, tape errors, and visual distortions that worsen as you advance.\n\n-Psychological Horror: A story that plays with your mind, questioning your perspective of reality and blurring the borders between fiction and truth.\n\n-Multiple Endings: Discover various outcomes based on your decisions throughout the assessment. Each ending provides a fresh viewpoint on your results.",
