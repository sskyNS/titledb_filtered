Dante, Malice, and Elliot have all been cast as outlaws, and it's up to you to help them clear their names. In a world that wants you both Dead AND Alive, there's no rest for the living and or unliving. Switch between these three unique characters, mastering their movements and attacks, and guiding them further into the story. \n\nPlay Single player or Co-op to solve puzzles! Enlist your friends to control all three characters locally, utilizing them to their maximum potential.
