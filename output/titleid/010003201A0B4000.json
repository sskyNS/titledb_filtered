The young neighbourhood kids will be at your side, and you\u2019ll also find some new friends along the way: The Champ, the Tinkerer, and the Wiz will lend you their skills and support in battle.\n\nWhat is the secret of the Crown of the Creation, and why are the Greed trying to steal it?\n\nNew and returning Monarchs: Grab your bikes and get ready for a Summer of Greed!\n\nA KINGDOM GAME FOR VETERANS AND NEWCOMERS\nBuilding upon the well-known mechanics in the Kingdom series, Kingdom Eighties adds a new storytelling approach.
