	"intro": "Sokobond Express is a beautifully minimalist puzzle game that combines chemical bonds and puzzling pathfinding in novel ways.",
	"description": "Starting with only one atom to navigate can feel like a breeze, but don\u2019t be fooled. As the game progresses and you learn new rules and mechanics, you\u2019ll have to maneuver multiple molecules simultaneously on the same screen, staying on your toes and consistently reconsidering the space around you as the challenge level ratchets up. Experiment with various solutions and watch your plan inevitably combust as you must consistently rethink and reevaluate your path forward.\n\nThoughtfully curated and surprisingly deep, Sokobond Express takes the guesswork out of chemistry, letting you feel like a chemist without requiring any upfront chemistry knowledge. Immerse yourself in this delightful, mechanically intuitive, and elegant experience while getting lost in the art of rewarding puzzle solving.\n\n\u2022 The minimalist mashup sequel to award-winning puzzle games Sokobond and Cosmic Express\n\u2022 Ambient and relaxing soundtrack to provide zen-vibes while puzzle solving\n\u2022 Created by up-and-coming puzzle designer Jose Hernandez, and published by renowned puzzle experts Draknek & Friends (A Monster's Expedition, Bonfire Peaks)",
