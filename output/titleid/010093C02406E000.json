	"description": "This is an action RPG released in Japan by Zainsoft in 1986. The player is a lone man who has crash-landed on a planet and explore this world of a long-dead ultra-advanced civilization, seeking a way to escape.\n\nThe game uses a quarter-view perspective with block-built terrain, creating a fairly vast world. Its block-based design can make many areas look similar, so you might get lost. Mapping your surroundings, checking landmarks and item locations during exploration is recommended. In dungeons, the perspective switches to top-down for better visibility, but they feature complex mazes and turret attacks, offering a fairly challenging adventure.\n\nCombat uses the familiar body-check mechanic of action RPGs. Firearms can be used with a key. Defeating enemies fills your experience gauge, and if it\u2019s full, you level up. This intuitive gameplay makes for an accessible system. The vertical gauge represents HP\u2014if it runs out, it\u2019s game over (but resting on the surface restores health, so watch it closely).\n\nIn this game, you explore a planet built of cubes. What secrets lie deep within this world of a long-lost ultra-advanced.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
