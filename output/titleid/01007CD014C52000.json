Take control of Jack, a survivor of the War of the Worlds trying to rebuild a working Heat Ray to blow his way to freedom and light the spark that will rebuild civilization. \n\nExplore the Horrors of the world after interplanetary war, encounter psychotic enemies suffering from prolonged exposure to Red Weed. Collect parts from fallen Tripod's and rebuild your own Heat Ray and maybe even come face to face with the few surviving Martians themselves.\n\nCraft weapons and items and combine them in interesting ways to take out the creatures left by the war, sneak your way past, or just shoot your way through. You decide.\n",
