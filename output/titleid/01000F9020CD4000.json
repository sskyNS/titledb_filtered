	"description": "Two young adults return to their lost hometown in search of truth and to bring back what they hold dear.\n\nStory:\nThe town of Hallfein was once situated at the border of three provinces, and thrived due to mining and trade. However, a mysterious disaster struck the town, causing most of its residents to disappear and leading to it becoming a restricted area.\n\nAs time passed, restrictions on the town were lifted, and a plan to restore it was initiated. Seizing this opportunity, a young woman and a young man, having come of age after being driven from Hallfein long ago, now return to the land they once called home.\n\nAfter meeting in their hometown, the two embark on a journey together to seek the truth, unaware of the encounters and revelations that await them...\n\nField:\nThis adventure is set on the Lantarna mainland. There are multi-level dungeons known as \"Dimensional Paths,\" where the map changes with each visit and rarer ingredients can be obtained as the difficulty level increases. Explore the dimensional paths in search of high-quality synthesis ingredients!\n\nCombat:\nCombat takes place in highly strategic timeline command battles. Up to three party members can be placed on both the front and back rows. Utilize new elements such as Multi-Actions, Item Mix, and Unite Attacks to add even more excitement to battles!\n\nSynthesis:\nCreate items through \"Gift Color Synthesis\" by linking the Gift Colors of ingredients. In addition to the required ingredients for each recipe, up to three additional ingredients can be added when synthesizing in order to transfer traits, allowing for both simple and in-depth synthesis! Make use of \"Recipe Morph,\" which can change the kind of item being created, as well as \"Catalyst Ingredients,\" which can change the Gift Colors of ingredients and the categories of ingredients that can be added, in order to create the best items possible!\n\nTown Development and Shop Management:\nSell the items you synthesize in your shop to develop the town! As the town develops, you'll obtain new synthesis recipes and unlock new parts of the main story.\n\nNote:\n- Please check the official site for details.\n- Please be aware that other editions containing this product exist.
