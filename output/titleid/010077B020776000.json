	"description": "Return to the style of 16-bit JRPGs in Starlight Legacy, a non-linear adventure inspired by genre classics! Set in a post-medieval world in the Evaria Kingdom, explore a vast kingdom created with lush 2D pixel art, a nostalgic turn-based battle system and non-linear story where the four provinces of the kingdom can be explored in any order of your choosing.\n\nIn Starlight Legacy, the four provinces of the Evaria Kingdom have lived in peace and prosperity for decades, thanks to the Eternity Tree that enriches and purifies the soil, water, and air of the entire kingdom. But a ban on the education of magic has caused unrest, leading to the rise of a separatist movement to liberate the Sky Province from Evaria.\n\nThe warriors Ignus and Teryl embark on a quest to deliver a sword requested by the king, but shortly after they embark, a devastating attack causes the Eternity Tree to whither. Ignus and Teryl now face the task of restoring the Eternity Tree to save the kingdom. And so begins a great journey through a seamlessly interconnected fantasy world!\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Search for powerful relics to restore the withered Eternity Tree!\n\u2022 Explore provinces in any order, with enemies and bosses scaled according to your overall progress.\n\u2022 Travel between towns, dungeons and field environments seamlessly with no load times.\n\u2022 Immerse yourself in a retro JRPG that mixes old-school 2D aesthetics with modern advancements!\n\u2022 Engage in menu driven turn-based combat inspired by genre classics.\n\u2022 Take to the skies in 3D flight sequences to quickly traverse the overworld map!",
