Why is he talking about the end of the world? And what does any of this have to do with Clara's quaint and peaceful life in Haven Heights?\n\nAll we know for sure is that if she doesn't embark on this quest... her friends will drag her into it anyway.\n\nAre you ready to solve the mystery of the God of Binary and uncover the truth of this strange but comfy world?\n\nWell... it doesn't really matter, does it?\n\nThere's no running from the truth \u2014 whether you're ready or not.",
