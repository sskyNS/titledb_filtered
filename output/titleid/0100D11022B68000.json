	"description": "\u300aThe Gameplay\u300b\n1. Come for a Ride\nIn most games, the story moves forward once your reach a certain destination. In Girls Made Pudding, everything happens during the journey. Nothing will happen if you stay where you are, and by going back on the road where you came from, you'll return to the dialogue you already read once.\nKeep the bike moving and the girls chatting and eventually you'll unfold this story's mysteries.\n\n2. Branching Roads, Branching Plot\nWhen you reach a branching road, that means that the plot is going to branch as well.\nThe story will move forward in different ways depending on whether you keep going straight or take a turn. You can also turn around and go check out a road you didn't choose before but the more you travel, the more the girls' \"fullness\" will decrease.\n\n3. Gathering and Cooking\nOn the road, you'll find ingredients that you can cook with.\nBy eating what you cook, you can increase the girls' fullness and other parameters.\nThere are some branches in the road that you can only access if the girls' parameters have reached a certain level too. (But you can remove this requirement in the difficulty settings.)\n\n\u300aThe Story\u300b\n\"When there's nobody there to see you, you disappear.\"\nIt's weird, but it's been like this for a while now. Almost half a year.\nThe journey started with Sumibi's wish\u2014\"I want to eat that pudding again.\"\nShe and Nikomi go on a bike trip, traveling from town to town while looking for ingredients and meeting new people. Little by little, they start understanding what happened to the world.\nThey keep traveling and they keep looking at each other... lest they disappear.\n\n\u300aThe Characters\u300b\nSumibi\nA bike-riding girl on a journey. She was a regular at the caf\u00e9 where Sumibi use to work.\nNikomi\nA girl traveling along with Sumibi. She used to work at a caf\u00e9 but she's not very good at baking and cooking.\n\n\u300aThe Staff\u300b\nProduction: KAMITSUBAKI STUDIO\nScenario and development: Kazuhide Oka\nCharacter design and concept art: Zumochi\nArt and character models: Zumochi\nSoundtrack: Daijiro Nakagawa\nLogo art: JEFF99\nEnglish Translation: Marco Godano\nSimplified/Traditional Chinese Translation: flankoi",
