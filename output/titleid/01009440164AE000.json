	"description": "Hunt the Night is a retro-style action-RPG that blends fast, skillful combat with dark fantasy lore. Play as Vesper, a member of the Stalkers, and traverse the ruined world of Medhram on a mission to save humanity from a deadly cycle of annihilation. Endure nightmarish overworlds, slash through horrific dungeons, face brutal bosses, and wield an arsenal of powers in a relentless struggle against the Night itself.\n\nIn the 9th Age, humanity is trapped in a vicious cycle on the verge of extinction. The day is ruled by humans, while the Night brings annihilation by horrid creatures. A group of humans called \u2018The Stalkers\u2019 once wielded power to hold back the horrors, but their sacrifice only delayed the inevitable.\n\nNow, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of a traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity. She hunts in a race against destiny, as the shadows lengthen both in the world and in her mind.\n\nENGAGE IN FAST-PACED DYNAMIC COMBAT\nDash through enemies while you unleash your combos, use your weapons or destroy them with your dark powers. You can switch between melee and ranged attack in quick succession: slashing enemies with your sword and then dashing away to use your ranged weapons, avoiding enemy attacks.\n\nFACE INTENSE CHALLENGING BOSSES\nEndure the ultimate challenge as you fight the ancient horrors of the Night that have been annihilating humanity over and over in intense boss battles. Learn their weak points, attack patterns and survive through the different combat phases as the battle gets more challenging and extreme.\n\nUPGRADE AND CUSTOMIZE VESPER'S BUILD\nCreate your own build that will adapt not only to your preferred gameplay but also to particular bosses. Customize the upgrades of your arsenal and use the equipment that best suits your gameplay: Critical Damage, Life Steal, Poison, Close Combat, Firepower and more. Collect Sanguine vials, Crow Feathers, Moonstones and Noctilium to increase your stats and get ready to face the Night.\n\nDISCOVER THE DARK WORLD OF MEDHRAM\nExplore Medhram in a combination of action-adventure and dark fantasy lore. Survive huge dungeons full of traps, enemies, puzzles and challenges. Discover all kinds of locations, from ancient cathedrals and libraries of knowledge to lost kingdoms and devastated floating cities.\n\nCOMPLETE 'HUNTS' AS A MEMBER OF THE STALKERS\nAccept a hunt at \u2018Crow\u2019s Nest\u2019 and track down the dark beast, find where it hides and hunt the most powerful creatures of the Night. After every completed hunt you will get rewards that will increase your health and dark energy bar.\n\nFIND SECONDARY CHARACTERS AND DISCOVER THEIR STORIES\nMeet new characters and discover their tragic past and stories in a world that is on the brink of the abyss.\n\nPLAY TO ADAPTED AND IMMERSIVE MUSIC\nImmersive and adapted music to every moment, boss and location, with the collaboration of Hiroki Kikuta.",
