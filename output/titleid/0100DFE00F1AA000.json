	"description": "Draw a scent-trail FROM CHEESE to Mouse. Think ahead, lay out your strategy, and see if your puzzle-solving skills can guide the mouse safely through the maze to bring food back to his starving colony. They need your help, now!\n\n58 Mind-Twisting, Reverse-Logic Puzzles\nThe mouse will always follow the scent-trail, but remember: the scent travels only from Cheese to Mouse, not the other way around. Keep an eye on the scent-bar. Use less scent to preserve the aroma and earn more stars.\n\nIntuitive Controls\nJust draw a trail from Cheese to Mouse, then hit PLAY and watch as the mouse follows the path. Made a mistake? With the scent-bar, you can rewind and fine-tune your trail at any point.\n\nRemote Buttons, Sliding Doors, and More\nLife\u2019s tough for a mouse in a maze designed by a maniac. Step on a button and a door may open, clearing the way to the Cheese. Step on another, and a vacuum cleaner might appear to suck up the trail. Keep your eyes open to discover all the tricks and traps hidden in each level.\n\nPredators and Prey\nWatch out for the sly cat. She lies in wait until a mouse dares to cross her carpet, then pounces! Can your mouse outsmart her? What if the cat crosses paths with the dog? Frozen in place! And beware the shady rat, lurking in the maze, eager to snatch the scent and steal the Cheese. Can you turn his steps to your advantage, or will you lure him into becoming prey for the hungry cat?\n\nRun, Mouse, Run!\nUnlock the power-up to boost the scent-trail. The mouse will dash faster, escape the cat, outpace the rat, or beat your own best time! But beware: enhanced scent consumes more of that precious aroma.\n\nCan you outsmart the maze and save the colony? The Cheese awaits!",
