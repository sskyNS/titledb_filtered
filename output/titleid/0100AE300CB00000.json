	"description": "STORY\nDuke of Defense is a playful action-based tower defense game brimming with ample humor, cheeky villagers, egotistical wizards, and jaunty adventure. Build, roll, and slash your way through waves upon waves of goblins, ogres, golems, and more! Upgrade your character as you advance through the story with a plethora of enhancements available within the skill tree. These abilities also apply in co-op mode, so everybody benefits! Be sure to visit the Wardrobe Well and cycle between loads of quirky heads to customize your Duke, unlocking more choices as you progress. Unique towers, potent powers, and 8-bit flowers ensure you'll be back for more. \n\nCO-OP\nAny true hero can call upon trusty companions in their time of need. Explore new strategies when you bring along a friend! Journey forth with a partner from the comfort of your couch, where you both can dash, slice, and build with local co-op multiplayer.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThis is an action-based tower defense like no other you've experienced. Slash goblins, ogres, wizards, and more with your sword, roll through waves of enemies, and build towers as fast as you can. Reap the rewards of combat by collecting coins from fallen foes, but tread carefully so as not to get walloped on the field of action! Turn the trees scattering the battlefield into a combination of the nine powerful towers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses against different monsters - so be sure to use your resources wisely! Prepare for fast-paced boss battles with some pretty angsty wizards, conversations with philosophical deer, and hordes of bit-constructed baddies. \n\nSOUNDTRACK\nThe whole experience is wrapped up in an unbelievable composition containing everything from sweat-inducing chiptunes to comedic ambience. Over 30 unique tracks!",
