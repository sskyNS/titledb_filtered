	"description": "After a visit to the psychologist that went horribly wrong you\u2019re trapped in the mind of a game developer on the brink of physical and emotional burnout during the last stages of an intense project. Experience a metroidvania-lite drenched in anxiety based on a very true story.\n\nBased on a true story and definitely inspired by real events\n\nUpgrades, weapons, bosses, enemies and all that jazz\n\nContains story*\n\n(* This game is not recommended for anyone with a peanut allergy)\n\nHave you ever seen a honky-tonk man bare as the day he was born? Contains full frontal pixel nudity\n\nHas no fusion jazz in it whatsoever\n\nProcedurally generated metroidvania, whatever that means\n\nDo you like movies about gladiators?\n\nBut hey, not down with anxiety? All of these above points can be completely skipped and you can plow your way through another tight platformer with killer mechanics (you can kill basically everything that moves), a banging chipmusic soundtrack (we couldn\u2019t afford real music) and more pixel art than you can stomach!\n\nThis is a prototype of a game we originally created back in 2020, also known as the best year ever. We decided back then to not make this game but now we\u2019re back more broke and desperate than ever and we\u2019re ready to make this thing a reality. To make sure this game will be a success, we asked three friends of ours and at least one of them was very excited, one didn\u2019t reply and one said we should get real jobs instead and stop calling him.\n\nHonesty is very important to us and when we're writing this we're not sure exactly what procedurally generated means. But what we've done is that we have a huge amount of different made rooms and each session they randomly appear so every playthrough is different!",
