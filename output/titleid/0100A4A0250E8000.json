	"description": "After a psychologist visit goes terribly wrong, you find yourself trapped in the mind of a game developer on the brink of physical and emotional burnout during the final stages of an intense project. Experience a metroidvania-lite drenched in anxiety and based on a very true story.\n\nFeatures:\n*Based on a true story and definitely inspired by real events\n*Upgrades, weapons, bosses, enemies and all that jazz\n*Contains story\n*Have you ever seen a honky-tonk man as naked as the day he was born? Contains full frontal pixel nudity!\n*Completely free of jazz fusion!\n*Procedurally generated metroidvania, whatever that means.\n*Do you like movies about gladiators? \n\n(This game is not recommended for anyone with a peanut allergy)\n\nBut hey, not down with anxiety? All of the points above can be completely skipped as you plow your way through another tight platformer with killer mechanics (meaning you can kill basically anything that moves), a banging chiptune soundtrack from the legendary Dunderpatrullen, and more pixel art than you can possibly stomach!",
