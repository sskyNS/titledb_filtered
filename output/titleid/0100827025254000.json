	"description": " - Overview\nPlace panels with various effects on a 3\u00d73 grid field and aim to clear the stage by pairing up all the characters on the field.\nThe Nintendo Switch\u2122 version adds 40 brand-new stages, bringing the total to a whopping 116 stages!\n\n - Gender\nBy default, couples are formed between a boy and a girl, but in the options you can change the settings to allow pairings such as boy-boy or girl-girl. There are also additional customization options available, such as clothing, hairstyles, and age.\n\n - Story\nThe protagonist is a woman in pajamas, as seen in the main visual. Her profession is a romance novelist.\nWhenever she comes up with ideas for her novels, she never skips her mental simulations. In her mind, she creates couples, makes them talk, go on dates, and flirt with each other-gradually expanding the image of her story.\nThis game (a puzzle game about forming couples) represents her fantasies-or rather, the work she does to pay her bills.",
