	"intro": "Face dangers and your own nightmares as you explore doomed starship in \u201cSyndrome\u201d -  a sci-fi survival horror. And remember, no one can hear you scream in space. ",
	"description": "YOU\u2019RE NOT ALONE\nYou wake up from cryosleep on \"Valkenburg\" - the most advanced science space station in the \u201cNovacore\u201d. The ship appears to be abandoned, but suddenly you hear a voice on the communicator that makes you aware of the situation. \n\nSomething from the abyss of space is kidnapping and killing the people on the ship. And it doesn't stop hunting. \n\nRUN. HIDE. FIGHT. SURVIVE. \nThe enemies are strong and they outnumber so you have no choice but to go out of sight. Unfortunately, sooner or later you will have to face them, then remember that there is not much ammunition on the science ship\u2026 \n\nStay in the shadows and survive! \n\nYOUR MIND IS ALSO YOUR ENEMY\nMeanwhile, strange things start happening to your mind. Will you trust the voice or are they against you too? Where did the \" thing\" on the ship come from? Will you be able to survive? \n\nExplore the dark corridors of a spacecraft and discover the mystery behind the disappearance of your crewmates. \n\nKey features:\n\n\u25cf Kill or be killed, surviving is a key: You\u2019ll find weapons on the ship, but the ammunition supply is limited. Count your bullets and stay in shadows. \n\n\u25cf Deadly adversaries: Enemies are dangerous, they\u2019re hunters so they\u2019ll follow any noises and investigate any disturbances so beware.  \n\n\u25cf Mental horror: Not just typical jumpscares - You\u2019re closed on a creepy, claustrophobic spaceship with countless horrors inside, both physical and psychological. \n\n\u25cf Intriguing plot: A seemingly simple mission turned into a bloody scenario -  it\u2019s up to you to find out what\u2019s really going on.\n\n\u25cf Deep lore to discover: Plenty of exploration awaits for you to do inside the ship, and many things to discover about the story. \n",
