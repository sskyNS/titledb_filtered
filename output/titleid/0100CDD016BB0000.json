On top of that you can play the daily sudoku, which is going to be the same for everyone in the world and will change every day. Finally you can also play random sudokus of various difficulties.\n\nIf you like sudokus, #1 Sudokus is the game for you and the last one you'll need to satiate your sudoku apetites!\n",
