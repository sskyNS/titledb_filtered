	"description": "You are an adventurer, the last of the Seekers of Cats, and you are tasked with an important job. Scattered on those islands are little cats, some of them are cold and hungry and yet still hoping someone will find them. Others don't really care about you or your quest but meow insistently anyway so you should probably stop for a moment and pet them too.\n\nFeatures:\n- 20 handcrafted islands\n- with lots of nooks and crannies to poke your head into\n- to find 100 little cats\n- while listening to charming music\n- and enjoying a bizarre and mysterious world",
