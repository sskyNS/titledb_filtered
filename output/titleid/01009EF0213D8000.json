	"description": "Primal Fray is a turn-based strategy roguelite. Combat takes place on a procedurally generated hex based flying islands. You will use your units to outmaneuver and kill enemy troops.\n\nDefeat Powerful Bosses\nThere are multiple bosses with unique mechanics. Will you be able to outsmart them? Or maybe build a perfect team to defeat them? Possibilities are endless but one is sure... It WON'T be easy.\n\nBuild Your Team\nAfter each combat you will get a different reward, making you choose next primal to join your team. This means that you will be making your team on the fly, having to improvise and work with what RNG gives you.\n\nUse Hundreds Of Abilities\nEvery unit has 4 different abilities in its arsenal with varying degree of strength and utility. The abilities either cost or produce mana, forcing you to manage this resource.\nPrimals may use those abilities to deal damage, shield allies, walk, fly, teleport, generate or exchange mana and even manipulate the battleground itself by creating or destroying hexes.\n\nChoose Your Way\nYou will have to make difficult choices, deciding between adding a new primal to a roster, getting an enchantment, a team heal, currency or visiting a merchant. Plan your way through the Rift and make the most out of the choices given to you.\n\nRecruit New Heroes\nChoose between multiple heroes. Use their unique talents to conquer the Rift and learn more about their stories entangled with dark and ominous Ironclad Corp.",
