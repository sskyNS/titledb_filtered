Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life.\n\n\u300aMain Features\u300b\n\u25a0 Exploring with new field actions!\nRyza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively.\n\u25a0 More action-filled real-time battles!\nTake on your enemies using an improved \u201creal-time tactics\u201d battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results.\n\u25a0 Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis!\nUtilize several new synthesis systems, including the new intuitive \u201cLinkage Synthesis\u201d system where items are placed in cells called \u201cMaterial Loops\u201d, that are designed to allow both new players to easily learn synthesis, and experienced players to create unique customized items. Created items can also be mixed and matched with \u201cEvolution Link\u201d to create entirely new items.",
