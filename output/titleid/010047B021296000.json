	"description": "The Tenshi no Uta series is widely regarded as one of the finest RPGs of its era, distinguished by its rare use of Celtic mythology and a central theme of romantic love between a man and a woman.\n\nIts collection of majestic background music is filled with must-hear masterpieces, perfectly complementing the emotionally immersive world, visual scenes, and story. In addition to the main narrative, the game offers numerous depth-driven elements\u2014such as searching for rare, character-specific weapons\u2014providing engaging gameplay that keeps players invested throughout their journey.\n\nSet in another world one hundred years after the previous title, the story follows the protagonist Fate, who encounters Riana, a young girl suffering from amnesia, and sets out on a journey to help her. In this other terrestrial realm beyond dimensions, the battle against the forces of darkness begins anew. Familiar characters, including Keal, the hero of the previous game, also return, and the weighty, continuous storyline\u2014enhanced by iconic lines and memorable music from the original\u2014delivers an emotionally stirring experience.",
