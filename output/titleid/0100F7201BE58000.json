	"description": "Experience a time-manipulation action game with unconventional controls.\n\n- Move limbs using the touchscreen.\nLimbs are linked to touch control and can be moved as desired.\nJump by moving the feet downward! Float gracefully through the air and punch enemies by moving the hands.\n\n- Two control methods\nWhen playing alone, you use the touchscreen; when playing with others, you tilt the Joy-Con\u2122 to control the limbs.\n\n- Bullet Time\nWhile the limbs are not moving, time almost stops.\nStop time, avoid enemy attacks coolly, and strike with precision.\n\n- Cooperative gameplay like a Three-Legged Race\nThe game supports co-op play.\nInstead of each player controlling a single puppet, each player manipulates a single hand or leg, working together to control the puppet.\nCommunication with your friends is the key to success.\n",
