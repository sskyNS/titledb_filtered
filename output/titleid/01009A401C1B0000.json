	"description": "Mirai Minato, a student at Mokuyo High School, is enjoying his ordinary days spent with his tsundere childhood friend, Meguri Sasaduka. She dutifully performs the childhood friend trope of waking him up in the morning by climbing in through his windo\u2015\n\n\u201cWh-what do you mean *Tsundere*?! You don\u2019t need to go that far for the game description!\u201d\n\nM-Meguri? How do you know what I\u2019m writing? Actually, that's not important right now. I\u2019m trying to set the scene and entice the reader with the setting of the game. \n\n\u201cTsk, fine. I\u2019ll just turn off the UI. I have to go anyway\u2026\u201d\n\nAnyway, as we were saying\u2026 Mirai\u2019s ordinary days come to a halt as he gets hit with meet cute after meet cute and he suddenly finds all kinds of romantic routes opening up before him! \n\n\u201cRight right! As expected of my Protagonist, he\u2019s pretty impressive right? Heheh, with my help he\u2019ll be surrounded by cuties in no time!\u201d \n\nGuh, Mei, please not right now, the person reading this might buy the game you\u2019re in. I'm doing my best to write an enticing description here!\n\n\u201cOh the player is reading this right now?! Listen, my life goal of frolicking with cute anime girls is at stake here! I\u2019m counting on you to get Mirai to introduce all the heroines to me, partner~\u201d\n\n*ahem* As Mei said, there are plenty of characters and routes to check out, so it will be up to you to make sure Mirai makes the right (or wrong) choices to navigate the often unpredictable routes to romance! \n\n\u201c...Ehehehe Mirai, he\u2019s so cool, isn\u2019t he? But what was that Mei girl saying about *OTHER* heroines, hm?\u201d\n\nHuh, Rumi? You\u2019re acting kind of strange, is everything ok? I was about to close out the description with a killer line about \u201cfinding love beyond the fourth wall\u201d or something, has the twinkle in your eye fallen out again? Sorry, I have to take care of this really quick\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\nHey! Rumi! I found it just down here!\n\n\u201cOh! Thank you so much- Ah! Sorry, was I interrupting the game description? Excuse me, and thanks again for finding it for me.\u201d\n\n\u2026 Nobody else is going to pop up? We\u2019re almost done right? Phew I can finally finish this thi\u2015\n\n*SQUAWK SQUAWK*\n\nGAH\u2015 WHAT IS A HAWK DOING HERE?! THERE ARE 3 MAIN ROUTES TO COMPLETE, WITH 20 SUB-ROUTES TO FIND AND\u2015\n\n*SQUAWK*\n\n J-JUST PLEASE BUY THE GAME ALREADY!",
