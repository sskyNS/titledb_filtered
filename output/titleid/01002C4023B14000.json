	"description": "The fairies are back \u2013 now with more crystals, more magic, and a lot more enchanted trouble! Mystic Pathways: Crystal Quest is the sparkling sequel that takes puzzles to a new level of strategic cuteness.\n\nYour job? Rotate pieces, build paths, and guide these tiny glowing creatures through mystical forests, portal-filled swamps, and glittering caves. All while trying to keep your sanity with trails that only get more challenging at every step.\n\nYou'll make wrong turns, dead ends, place fairies where they shouldn't be... and you'll love every second of it.\n\nThree magical worlds await you:\n\nEnchanted Forests: where everything starts calm, green, and... relatively easy.\n\nMagical Swamps: with portals, more fairies, and much less patience.\n\nAncient Caves: where you apply everything you've learned... and maybe call for reinforcements.\n\n30 levels full of logic, strategy, and pure mystical energy.\n\nRotate pieces. Redo paths. Collect crystals. And try not to get lost in the enchantment.\n\nMagic has never been so confusingly fun.",
