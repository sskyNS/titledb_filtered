	"description": "Released in 1988 by COMPILE for the MSX2 in Japan, this action RPG is an enhanced version of \"Golvellius\" which was released for the MSX the previous year. In this game, players take on the role of the knight Kelesis, who embarks on an adventure to rescue Princess Rena in the Valley of Monsters while searching for his sister.\n\nThis game is known for its brisk action and features changing stages depending on the game scene. Players can enjoy an adventurous and combative experience in \"field screen\" mode, which allows free movement in eight directions, progress through \"side-scrolling screens\" by utilizing attacks and jumps, and advance upward in \"vertical scrolling screens\" reminiscent of shooting or racing games, providing an exciting gameplay experience.\n\nWhile the game can be challenging due to tough enemies requiring rapid button pressing, and some dead ends in scrolling screens that might be considered \"cheap deaths\", it remains a highly recommended title for fans of Compile and those who seek a challenging action RPG experience.\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
