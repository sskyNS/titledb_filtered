The AI has been activated, and it's performing a quick system check.\n\nFEARLESS RACCOON\nYou play as a raccoon that has no interest in the fancy defense systems, a raccoon that only wants to get its filthy hands on the station's trash.\n\nCHALLENGING FIGHTS\nExplore an interconnected maze of space station's rooms as you destroy robots, collect power-ups and unlock shortcuts. With each level completed, the difficulty of fighting with enemies increases.\n\nSINGLE SPAWN SPOT\nThe progress saves automatically. Everytime you die, you reappear in one single spawn spot. But any power-ups, abilities, or shortcuts you've unlocked will remain.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\u25cf Metroidvania platformer with zero checkpoints\n\u25cf Cute protagonist - you play as a raccoon\n\u25cf Dynamic action and difficult boss fights\n\u25cf Pixel art graphics and a unique soundtrack",
