It consists of 40 levels of a platformer that can be played like one player or with friends up to 4 players and a variety of 12 arenas where you will fight with your friends as a team or against each other. \n\nA platformer as a part of the game consists of locations with different physics obstacles. 1 - the main obstacle is a trampoline. 2 - the main obstacles are an ice, a sled, snowballs. 3 - the main obstacles are a rope and logs on the water. 4 - a jetpack. Each location has a candy which you have to carry to the finish of the level. You can pass a level without a candy, by doing a speedrun only but you have to keep in mind that a candy and speedrun give you stars which you can use to open new levels. These levels will be passed by you or you with your friends by a network multiplayer or local multiplayer.\n\nThe game has 12 different arenas also.\n - basketball\n - football\n - soccer\n - volleyball\n - the last life\n - boxes to one row\n - collecting\n - death match\n - catch up\n - obstacle course\n - holding a flag\n\nHave fun with friends as you like.
