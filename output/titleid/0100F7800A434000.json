Use your phone or tablet to draw funny and challenging things like \u201ccreepy tiger\u201d or \u201ctwo moms having a great day.\u201d\n\nPlayers type in what they think the (probably terrible) drawing really is and then everyone - even an audience of potentially thousands of players \u2013 votes on what they think is the correct answer.\n\nDrawful 2 is a go-to party game that everyone can play and enjoy!\n\nDrawful 2 improves on the original Drawful with the ability to add your own user-generated prompts to make even weirder games full of in-jokes with your friends, as well as expanded tools for streaming.\n\nNote: This game is local multiplayer, but can be enjoyed over streams with remote players.\n\n\n",
