Form a party, equip your stagecoach, and set off across the decaying landscape on a last gasp quest to avert the apocalypse. The greatest dangers you face, however, may come from within...\n\nGather your courage and ride out into the chaos of a world undone.\nFour heroes and a stagecoach are all that stand between darkness and salvation.\n\nRoguelike Runs, Each With Its Own Emerging Story\nEach expedition lasts from 30 minutes to several hours. Even an untimely end will arm you with resources that can be spent to improve your next journey.\n\nThe Affinity System\nAs travels progress, heroes bond with each other or grate on each others\u2019 nerves, leading to desperately needed combat synergies or journey-ending dysfunction. Manage their stress and interaction to keep the team together until the bitter end.\n\nFace Your Failures\nUncover and experience the tragic origin stories of each hero and unlock their full potential.\n\nNightmarish Environs\nFrom the burning Sprawl to the diseased Foetor, the road will challenge your strategies and your endurance.\n\nAnd more...\nRest your weary, shell-shocked heroes at the Inn, where you can manage their stress and relationships with a variety of diversions and delights.\nUncover and experience the tragic origin stories of the heroes.\nA stylish and dynamic evolution of Darkest Dungeon\u2019s signature art style.\nA return of the narration system and voice actor Wayne June!\nExciting improvements to the turn-based combat from Darkest Dungeon.",
