	"description": "Get ready to hop into action in Bunny Pit Stop, a puzzle game where a clever rabbit mechanic takes center stage. Inspired by the classic push-and-place style, your mission is simple but tricky: push cars into their maintenance bays and keep the garage running smoothly. The game is designed to be casual and relaxing, but don\u2019t let that fool you. Each level introduces new layouts and patterns that make you think ahead, plan your moves, and find the perfect sequence to clear the board. You\u2019ll start small, with just one or two cars per puzzle. Soon enough, the challenge grows as more cars crowd the space, demanding careful strategies and creative solutions. No timers, no stress, just you, the bunny, and the satisfying click of every car finding its spot. Explore three unique biomes across 35 levels. The Garage is messy and filled with oil stains, tires, and barrels, marking the beginning of your rabbit\u2019s career. Then comes the Pit Stop, right next to the racetrack, with vibrant details like vegetation and advertisement signs. Finally, the Track Median sets the stage with scattered objects, cacti, and hints of crashes, making each puzzle feel alive. With its charming theme and smooth progression, Bunny Pit Stop is the perfect choice for puzzle lovers who want a relaxing yet engaging experience.",
