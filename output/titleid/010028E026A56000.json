	"description": "Cargo Runner: Mars puts you in charge of high-risk supply deliveries on the Red Planet.\n\nRemote colonies depend on regular cargo shipments, but the routes are hostile. Alien ambushes, unstable delivery zones, and strict operational requirements turn every job into a test of speed, control, and decision-making.\n\nCombat is direct. Step out of your vehicle, deal with the threat, collect what\u2019s left, and move on.\nMoney earned unlocks new weapons, vehicles, and upgrades for future runs.\n\nProgress is persistent. Upgrades and base improvements provide long-term advantages, rewarding repeated missions and exploration.\n\nYou deliver. Mars decides if you survive.",
