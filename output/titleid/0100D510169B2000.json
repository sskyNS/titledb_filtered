	"description": "Archery Club is an archery game with multiple exciting game types and an extensive upgrade system. Become a master archer, collect the best equipment and win!\n\nFEATURES:\n\u25b6 EXCITING ARCHERY MATCHES: Each match consists of multiple game types!\n\u25b6 EXTENSIVE UPGRADE SYSTEM: Find new pieces to strengthen your bows!\n\u25b6 MULTIPLE DETAILED VENUES: Shoot your way to victory in different environments.\n\nArchery Club lets you pick your favorite bow and play in exciting, multi-part matches! During each one of them you\u2019ll play at least two out of three possible game modes:\n\nShortbow - a quick, 30-second long round where your reflexes and fast aiming skills will be put to the test.\n\nLongbow - a longer round with 3 shots for each of the players. The distance to the target will increase after each shot, so you\u2019ll have to be mindful of gravity and wind!\n\nCompoundbow - a more strategic round, where you\u2019ll have to decide which targets to shoot. Those that guarantee better score may be way harder to hit, so decide carefully!\n\nEach match is played as a Best Of 3 with those game types selected in random order. You\u2019ll have to master all of them if you want to keep winning and climbing up in the ranks!\n",
