	"description": "The boys are back and ready for some arcade-style action in Otoko Cross: Pretty Boys Breakup! The original cast of Jules, Quincy, Haru, Morgan and Kyun are joined by 4 newcomers, all with unique backstories and voiced in Japanese. As you play through challenging brick-breaking stages of arcade action, you\u2019ll get closer to the boys by spending points you\u2019ve earned in a new in-game shop system to unlock feminine crossdressing outfits and background images to assemble custom dioramas.\n\nThe brick-breaking stages of Pretty Battle mode gradually increase in difficulty. Take control a twin-tailed fighter wielding a beam saber and swat the ball towards block targets above. Some blocks drop power-ups, while others take multiple strikes to break. As the action intensifies, enemy ships will appear and fire at you, propellers will deflect shots, turrets will track your position and more, adding a tough-but-fair bullet hell element. Once you\u2019ve cleared all 36 main stages, you can also push your limits with endless challenges. How long can you last?\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Battle through 36 stages of brick-breaking arcade action!\n\u2022 Meet a cast of 9 crossdressing \u201cotokonoko\u201d characters, all voiced in Japanese.\n\u2022 Change ball speeds, collect power-ups, dodge enemy attacks and deflect incoming fire.\n\u2022 Master 2 unique game modes, including endless challenges for unlimited replay value!\n\u2022 Earn points to exchange for new outfits and backdrops in any order you desire.\n\u2022 Assemble custom dioramas using the characters and clothing you\u2019ve unlocked.",
