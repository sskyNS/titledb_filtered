	"description": "Kells is a puzzle game where you have the power to change the laws of gravity and guide your team of little green dudes to safety in each level. \n\nThere are over 100 levels in the game, dozens of secrets and mysteries to uncover and over 45 Kells in total to collect as you explore the world map on your journey to The Last Level. \n\nCompleting the story is just the beginning, however. Unlocking all the levels is really just a rather long tutorial  in disguise designed to prepare you for the real challenge - competing in The Iron Kell! Do you have what it takes to perfect the Iron Kell and become a true Kells Champion?",
