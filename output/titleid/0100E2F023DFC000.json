	"description": "Welcome to a world of crazy organizers, explosive makeup bags, and kitchen shelves barely holding on under the weight of random stuff! In Stuff It, there\u2019s only one rule: everything has to fit... somewhere!\n\n\nYour mission? To cram the most absurd combinations of items into tight spaces. Hairbrushes, colorful hairdryers, giant ladles, way too many trinkets, and even rubber duckies - all waiting for your master-level packing skills!\n\n\nEach level throws you into a totally new challenge - bizarre shapes, unruly objects, and sometimes things you don\u2019t even remember ever owning. But don\u2019t panic! Use your superpower of organizing, make some room, and... stuff it!\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in store?\n- Over 105 levels of chaos to conquer!\n- Special modes (Easy, Medium, Hard) unlocked after completing the game - for those who  love a challenge!\n- Dozens of colorful items - from kitchen gear to beauty products!\n- Relaxing, feel-good music to help you focus\u2026 even when everything is falling out!\n- Wacky graphics that bring every drawer item to life!\n- Funny effects and reactions - because every win deserves a fanfare (and confetti)!\n\nDon\u2019t ask where that giant spoon came from - just find a spot for it!\n\nStuff It - because who said cleaning can't be epic?",
