	"description": "Hikaru finds himself out of luck and homeless on an unfamiliar island. \n\nWhile avoiding pit vipers and angry senior committee members, he comes across a witch in a very similar situation. \n\nThe two set out to survive, and hopefully thrive, on Toyotoki, the uncompromising island secluded from the modern world that is steeped in ancient traditions and shrouded in mystery.\n\nAlong the way, they meet a cheeky island beauty, a haughty rich girl, a clumsy saleswoman, and a manga-loving delinquent, all of whom are island locals on a similar mission to discover themselves and their place in the world. \n\nWith some hard work and a sprinkle of magic, can the unlikely group of friends unravel the mystery of Toyotoki Island, while also finding success in their journey of self-discovery?",
