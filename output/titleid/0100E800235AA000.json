	"description": "This is a remake of the real-time action RPG \"Xanadu,\" originally released in Japan by Nihon Falcom in 1985, and released in Japan in 1995, ten years after the original. Players become adventurers and explore all 10 stages while battling monsters, with the ultimate goal of defeating the King Dragon.\n\nCombat uses symbol encounters. Monster contact starts battles where players fight with weapon attacks (body slams) and magic. Defeating foes spawns treasure chests with items and money. Monsters are finite; they vanish when hunted out.\n\nThe character development system powers up weapons and magic with use. Players have warrior and mage experience/levels, growing towards either style based on attack type. Weapons, armor, and magic also gain experience, improving with use. Weapon or magic choice matters. Since monsters are finite, development and item management are key to character/item growth.\n\nThis revival version enhances various aspects of the original. Graphics are upgraded to 400 lines and 16 colors for greater vibrancy! The BGM is also improved, with different music for each level and dedicated tracks even within towers. Furthermore, this version features a map function, allowing players to check terrain and monster locations at any time, aiding their adventure.\n\n\"Revival Xanadu\" retains the original's difficulty while enhancing graphics and BGM, and improves playability with the map function. This exemplary revival, a model for remakes, is highly regarded by many retro game fans.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
