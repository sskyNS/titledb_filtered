	"intro": "The goal of the game is to blast the alien forces and get the highest score possible with your three lives.\nThe tougher the enemy is to destroy, the greater the chance they will drop a valuable power-up. \nCollect them to help fight off the alien vermin and earn yourself the highest score.\nThe power-ups can be a one-shot event or a timed event. \nThere are FOUR different powerful items to collect, Triple Shot, Single Beam Shot, Shield and Slow Time\nThe alien Command Ship will randomly spawn from time to time and hover across the screen behind the alien invaders.\n If you destroy the Command ship, you\u2019ll be awarded a random point value between 100 and 500 points.\nThe difficulty ramps up quickly with the infestation\u2019s relentless attack intensifying as time progresses. \n",
