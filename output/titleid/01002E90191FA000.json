	"description": "Step into an ethically compromised future where cloning technology has wreaked havoc on humanity \u2013 and it\u2019s sort of all YOUR fault! As an employee of nefarious megacorp, Infinity Inc., and the inventor of its Quantic Matter Replication Device (aka the QMRD, aka the cause of the world going to hell in a handbasket), it\u2019s up to you to sort out the mess you helped create.\n\nGrab your cloning gun and hot-foot it through a world descending into clone-induced chaos. Create clones of yourself and use them to solve puzzles and save humanity. Get to it genius!\n\nKey Features:\nCreate clones! Make endless copies of yourself with the cloning gun and use your perfectly formed doppelgangers \u2013 up to four at once \u2013 to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles\n\nSacrifice clones! Dystopias are very dangerous places, and many clones will suffer hilariously gruesome deaths along the way. Fried! Crushed! Mangled! Minced! RIP clones :(\n\nExplore a world of weirdness! From suspiciously friendly AI and cultish crackpots, to modified corn and cloned panda bears. This freaky future has (almost) everything!\n\nThink about ethics! Is it better that a clone should die, rather than the real you? Consider the morality of human cloning as you condemn countless versions of yourself to death\n\nHave a mustache! Play as a hero with sweet facial hair. Purely cosmetic. Totally badass",
