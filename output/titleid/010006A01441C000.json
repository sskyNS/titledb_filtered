	"description": "Recalling the visual style and intuitive gameplay of 16-bit action-adventure classics, Trigger Witch puts an ultra-violent spin on cute and colorful pixel art. With a compelling and original narrative, puzzling environments to explore, a dynamic soundtrack, twin-stick shooter mechanics and a vast array of enemies to blast into smithereens, this is a tale that will grip you from start to bloody finish.\n\nFrom the creators of Reverie, Trigger Witch is a stylized 2D twin-stick action game set in an odd open world where magic is outdated and firearms are the new way of life. Players assume the role of Colette, a prospective graduate from the Stock, an academy for Witchcraft and Triggery. After a mysterious man invades her realm, events are set in motion that turn Colette\u2019s life upside-down, casting her as the sole heroine with enough firepower to restore peace.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Explore an open world in classic action-adventure style!\n\u2022 Wield and upgrade new firearms as you progress.\n\u2022 Meet strange and endearing characters through engaging dialogue.\n\u2022 Blast monsters back to their rightful plane of existence in bloody fashion!\n\u2022 Solve environmental puzzles and overcome obstacles in clever ways.\n\u2022 Play solo or multiplayer at any time, with drop-in local co-op.",
