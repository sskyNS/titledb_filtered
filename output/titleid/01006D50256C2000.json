	"description": "Vine Card is a deck-building strategic game with roguelike elements. Choose from a roster of quirky heroes with even quirkier skills, plan your route around the game board,\ngrab the goodies and defeat the baddies Navigate your hero around a game board of limited grids, one step at a time.\n\nSounds boring? Well, throw in a deck of 200+ unique cards, and watch the chemical reactions happen. 8 playable characters with wildly different styles/skills further increase the fun.\n\nIt all starts from this fictitious empire on a fictitious planet. The Tang Empire is facing a pivotal moment and from there, things start to go wild. Follow our heroes from the Tang Empire to the Far West, then the mysterious Skyland descending from the, duh, sky!\nEmbark on a journey that is natural, semi-natural, supernatural, meta-natural, and unnatural at the same time! Blend Wuxia and science fiction and fantasy and mythology together and it just works.\n\nTake elements from Chinese mythology, Norse mythology, Celtic mythology, Arthurian mythology, Cthulhu mythology (yeah, we've got that covered, too), add modern pop culture, sprinkle a liberal dose of actual history, serve while hot.\n\nGatling guns vs swords vs crossbows vs pretty much anything you can think of.\nWho said cowboys can't do Chinese kungfu, eh? Leave common sense behind, dude. It's holding you down.\n\nThe game comes with 30+ handcrafted \"legend site\" stages, from the mysterious Sanxingdui to the isle of Avalon to the glorious Valhalla. Take a break from the busy combat and solve these special challenges instead!",
