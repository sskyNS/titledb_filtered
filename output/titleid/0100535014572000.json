	"description": "***** Story *****\nYou are \"Prince Natri\", have won the trial to be next king in the previous adventure. But there is a person who disagrees. It is his mother, Queen Silica. She was traveling as an official work when the trial had been held.\n\n\"Why did you do such an interesting event without me!?\"\n\nShe is like a trouble maker, so tells Prince Natri to take the trial again. In addition, he is introduced a Lady. Her name is Helim.\n\n\"Prince, I want to guard you perfectly.\"\n\nShe is a new member of the guardian force \"Escorts\". But on probation, not professional. Therefore, she has been ordered to guard Prince Natri as the final test.\n\nAlthough she is quite a stranger, he must explore the dungeon together. What happens in this adventure!?\n\n***** Overview *****\nThis is turn-based Simulation RPG. Rules are simple and reasonable, but never easy. We made the new Thinking Program \"SESS-AI\", so enemies are very strong. Probably, stronger than other SRPG you know.\n\nEnemies do many many actions. Normal Attack, Magic Attack, Healing, Pull, Pushing, Exchange, Lifting, Disturb, Increase and Decrease parameters, Create and Remove Jamming Area, Blocking, Guarding, Inviting, and... Run Away! You will be surprised at them. Of course, you can also do these actions. Beat the Thinking Program \"SESS-AI\" in the simulation battle!\n\n***** Language *****\nEnglish and Japanese are available.\n",
