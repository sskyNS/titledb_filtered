	"description": "Welcome to a world where desire, destiny, and strategy collide.\n\nIn Arcana, the legendary Tarot cards are no longer symbols.\nThey are seductive, powerful women, each one representing a different Arcana with her own personality, intentions, and hidden motives.\n\nTalk to them.\nGo on dates to unlock new abilities.\nGain their trust\u2026 or provoke their ambition.\n\nBut connection is only the beginning.\n\nWhen conflict begins, conversations give way to strategic, roguelite-inspired card battles, where each run challenges you to adapt, plan, and evolve your approach.\n\nBuild your deck using the Arcana you\u2019ve bonded with and face enemy armies in encounters where every card matters.\n\nYour choices shape more than relationships.\nThey define how your Arcana fight, how they evolve, and which powers they are willing to unleash for you.\n\nThis is not a traditional visual novel.\nThis is a fusion of narrative intimacy and tactical card combat.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u25cf ARCANA AS CHARACTERS: \nThe Tarot comes to life as powerful, seductive women, each with unique abilities, personalities, and motivations.\n\n\u25cf NARRATIVE PROGRESSION & DATES:\nTalk to the Arcana, go on dates, and unlock new skills that directly affect combat.\n\n\u25cf STRATEGIC ROGUELITE CARD COMBAT:\nEvery run is different. Adapt your deck, manage risk, and refine your strategy as challenges escalate.\n\n\u25cf DECK BUILDING & SYNERGY:\nCreate powerful combinations using the Arcana you\u2019ve bonded with and shape your own playstyle.\n\n\u25cf ARMY BASED ENCOUNTERS:\nFace increasingly dangerous enemy forces in tactical card battles where positioning and timing matter.\n\n\u25cf CHOICE DRIVEN EVOLUTION:\nYour decisions influence how the Arcana grow, fight, and what powers they are willing to reveal.\n\n\nSome Arcana seek control.\nOthers crave devotion.\nAll of them have a price.\n\nWill you master the cards\u2026\nor let them master you?",
