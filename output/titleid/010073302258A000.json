	"description": "CURSE THOSE BULLETS! \nUse Curse Bullets to dynamically alter the difficulty as you play. Wipe out smaller enemies and clear projectiles from the screen, or power up larger enemies, making them harder to defeat... The greater the risk the higher you\u2019ll score, and you can even curse yourself to increase your damage to overcome more challenging enemies.  \n\nSCROLL YOUR WAY \nIn this vertical-scrolling shoot \u2018em up, you control the scroll. If you don\u2019t move forward, your character won\u2019t advance through the stage. But be warned; the game is timed, so standing still all day isn\u2019t an option! \n\nAN ARCADE CLASSIC \nMamorukun Curse! originally debuted in Japanese arcades in mid-2008. Drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese mythology and blending it into a colorful, charming, and family-friendly world. \n\nCOMPLETE AND ENHANCED \nThe game now supports widescreen format and modern twin-stick controls. On top of that, it\u2019s absolutely packed with content! Story Mode, Arcade Mode, Challenge Courses, previously released DLC characters, alternate costumes, Gallery Mode... There\u2019s almost as much to discover as there are bullets... ",
