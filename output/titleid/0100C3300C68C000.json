Embark with Flint Trucker on a crazy journey to reunite him with sweet Angelina, and try not to succumb to the madness that awaits you!\n\nHUGE BOSSES\nDon't let their size scare you!

Go get \u2018em, Flint!\n\nCRAZY WEAPONS\nRanging from standard revolvers and shotguns to deadly contraptions with crazy and unexpected effects. You can even saddle a rocket to disintegrate flying enemies. The choice is up to you!\n\nBEAUTIFULLY HAND-DRAWN GRAPHICS\nFor Creepy Road, we have created a truly mad world with over 30 original kinds of funny and furious enemies, from animals and birds to psychos.

All the characters and locations were painstakingly designed with a great love of details!\n\nMain character\nFlint Trucker is a good guy with a rich inner life.
