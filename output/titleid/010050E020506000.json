	"description": "Ed & Edda: GRAND PRIX - Racing Champions is a fast-paced racing game for the whole family that brings the famous Europa-Park mascots Ed & Edda to life for the first time in a video game to coincide with the worldwide release of the animated feature film \u2018GRAND PRIX OF EUROPE\u2019!\n\nYou can race with the two heroes or six other colourful characters that fans of the film will recognise! The races take players to various well-known locations across Europe to compete in Free Races, the Points Chase, Time trial or the Grand Prix!\n\nEach character not only has their very own racing car, but also individual strengths and weaknesses, which means that each race can be driven very differently depending on which character you take to the track!\n\nBut Ed & Edda: GRAND PRIX - Racing Champions is not just a game that is great fun to play alone: in a race with two, three or even four players, every family and every group of friends can create their very own memories in the world of the Racing Champions - because with Ed & Edda, too, it's true: a shared game is often twice the fun!\n\n\u00a0\nKey features of Ed & Edda: GRAND PRIX - Racing Champions:\n\nRace over exciting tracks in many world-famous European locations\n\nChoose between eight well-known characters, including Ed & Edda, the legendary Europa-Park mascots\n\nUnleash unique driving skills, master power-ups and customise your race car to make every race feel unique\n\nLong-term modifications to the racing car and unlockable improvements keep the replay value high\n\nA split-screen mode for local multiplayer races of 2 to 4 players invites families to have fun together and create their very own memories in the world of Ed & Edda.",
