	"intro": "SPACEBASE STARTOPIA captivates with its original mixture of economic simulation and empire building strategy paired with classic RTS skirmishes and a good dose of humor. And as if maintaining the three Space Station Decks, entertaining the eight Alien races and defending against enemy invaders were not enough of a challenge, the dynamic narrator AI is not going to mince matters and commentates the events in a lovely but sharp-tongued manner.\n\n\n- The 10-mission, fully dubbed single-player Campaign will require all your skills as Commander of the Spacebase Startopia as you strive to create one of the most attractive trade and tourism destinations in the known universe.  \n- Each of the three Decks will require your leadership skills, with the Sub Deck containing all of the Rooms vital to survival, while the Fun Deck focuses on your visitors and the flora and fauna found on the Bio Deck provides sufficient Resources for survival as well as a home to the graceful Dryads.\n- Prevail against your competitors, for you are not alone on the Space Station. Sabotage your opponents' economy or attack them with your Mech Units, conduct trade and beware of Space Pirates eager to board your Station.\n- The dynamic narrator AI \u201cVAL\u201d reacts to your decisions and is always at your side in both word and deed \u2013 and the occasional extremely unqualified comment.\n- Hone your skills as the Commander of Spacebase Startopia in the many challenges of the singleplayer campaign or play your way in the customizable sandbox mode.",
