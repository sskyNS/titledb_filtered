When a sudden assault devastates their homeland of Rughzenhaide, the two are forced to escape\u2026 but somehow end up teleported into an unknown forest full of vegetation they don\u2019t recognize. The atmosphere is thick and heavy. There is no sign of life, which is very unusual for such a lush forest. Something is wrong about the land\u2026 But they are too startled to notice what.\n\nWho were the attackers and what was their goal?\nWhere did Selphine and Ritona end up?\nWill the two make it home safely?\nAnd more importantly, what has happened to their homeland?",
