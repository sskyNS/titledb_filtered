Shoot them up by yourself or co-op together with a friend!\n\nMaster the art of getting closer and beat the heck out of them!\n\nPlay as one of three playable characters accompanied with their Options. Shoot the wide shot, focus shot, deploy the bombs, or unleash their special!\n\nYou don't have to fight alone; get a friend and play together in Two Player where they control the Options directly! Or control both characters at once with just one controller with Dual Control!\n\nBrave Rounds tells a touching story of inter-generational relationships and the lengths people take to accomplish their goals. Set in the occult and sci-fi-laden modern era of 20XX, Brave Rounds explores the worth in fighting for what you believe in.\n\nFeatures:\n- Arcade Mode, the game's main mode of high-intensity five stages action. Fight the mid-bosses, bosses, and watch out for the dynamic difficulty: Rank! Are you worthy enough to face the True Last Boss...?\n- Stage Practice, for your practicing convenience. Whenever you get stuck at Arcade Mode, visit the Stage Practice.\n- Story Mode, telling a different story from Arcade Mode, is where you tackle 41 bite-sized stages.
