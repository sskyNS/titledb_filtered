	"description": "The Pocket Card Jockey so well-received on Nintendo 3DS\u2122 has galloped its way onto Nintendo Switch\u2122, and it\u2019s more fun than ever! Easy to learn, but filled with surprising depth, you\u2019ll put together the best hands you can to help your horses take home the gold!\n\nSolitaire in this game is played by clearing away cards one number higher or lower than your current card. While the game\u2019s overall concept is the same as before, it includes new rules that allow for more strategic play, as well as racing segments reborn in glorious 3-D.\n\nWhether you\u2019re trying just one race per day, competing with players from all over the world online with the strongest horses you've bred, conquering the biggest races in the world, or just collecting cute little horses, a good time is always in the cards!",
