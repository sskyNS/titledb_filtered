At the same time, Dorfromantik offers a challenge for those who are looking for one: To beat the highscore, you need to carefully plan and strategically place your tiles.\n\nGameplay:\nYou start with a stack of procedurally generated tiles. One after the other, you draw the top tile of the stack, place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit. Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits. As you expand the landscape, you can advance into new, colorful biomes and discover pre-placed game objects that give you long-term tasks. Through these tasks you can unlock new tiles, new biomes and new quests.\n\n\nWhat Dorfromantik offers:\n\u2022 Building vast and beautiful landscapes\n\u2022 Unique mix of strategy and puzzle mechanics\n\u2022 Relaxing and calming gameplay\n\u2022 Idyllic village scenery\n\u2022 Strategic placement to beat the highscore\n\u2022 High replay value - every session is different\n\u2022 Many unlockable tiles and biomes\n\u2022 Original Artstyle with handpainted boardgame feel\n\u2022 Different game modes for different player types\n\nWhat Dorfromantik does not offer:\n\u2022 4X Strategy\n\u2022 Trading\n\u2022 Resource Management\n\u2022 Combat & Violence\n\u2022 Multiplayer",
