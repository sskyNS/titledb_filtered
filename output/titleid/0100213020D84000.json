	"description": "A decade has passed since the events of Twin Breaker: A Sacred Symbols Adventure. After successfully unraveling the mystery behind NASA\u2019s disappearing generation ships, heroic pilots Colin and Chris have entered quiet lives of retirement. But the copious data they brought back from their remarkable journey has been fully studied, and shadowy government figures are keen on exploiting new discoveries to achieve potentially sinister ends. Can a third hero -- the brave government liaison Dustin -- convince the boys to put a stop to the renewed madness? If Twin Breaker was a brick breaker about space, Tri Breaker is a brick breaker on steroids, and this go-around, it\u2019s all about time. Explore 40 brand new stages spread across four periods of galactic history, and obliterate the brick-breaking formula with new action-oriented gameplay quirks and formulas that you\u2019ve never seen before in the genre. With boss fights, tons of story and dialogue, a retro-fueled soundtrack, and much more, Tri Breaker: A Sacred Symbols Odyssey is inspired by the one of the most popular video game podcasts on Earth, Sacred Symbols, is written by long-time gaming personality Colin Moriarty, and is the sixth title from Lillymo Games.",
