	"description": "Hiding behind the mask of the average man on the street, and furtively blending into the background, many war criminals, ex-Mafia members and other criminals have been literally getting away with murder, or worse. That is, until you turned up to ruin the party. As part of a secret and\u00a0mysterious society whose members have sworn to rid the world of these Bad Guys, it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure justice is served in the bloodiest possible way, using your unpredictability to your advantage.\n\nTrack the Bad Guys, be brutal and smart in your planning, and eliminate them one by one. But bear this in mind: each criminal\u2019s death has to look like an accident. In each level, you\u2019ll have the chance to splatter and destroy the Bad Guy using various weapons and traps. It\u2019s up to you to make sure he ends up in the wrong place at the right time.\n\nIn this ingenious puzzle game in which physics plays an essential role, you\u2019ll need to keep a cool head and your wits about you. Show no mercy as you set out to kill the Bad Guy!\n\u201cUntil your mission is accomplished we don\u2019t exist. If you fail, you\u2019ll be the only person at fault, and we\u2019ll deny ever knowing you.\u201d\n\nFeatures\nTRACK YOUR TARGET in 60 levels, each one more original than the last, and unlock 6 completely off-the-wall bonus levels.\nUSE YOUR IMAGINATION as you take out the criminals one by one. Find the opportune moment to act, and make it as bloody as you can!\nBECOME THE AMBASSADOR OF DEATH and make full use of all the different traps available. Sabotage vehicles, transform daily objects into deadly weapons, or combine different elements in order to create new ones.\nWORK IN THE SHADOWS. Don\u2019t draw attention to yourself. Cameras, pedestrians, cops and the Bad Guys\u2019 bodyguards mustn\u2019t suspect you. No one should ever doubt that these deaths are anything but unfortunate accidents.\nTRY, TRY AND TRY AGAIN as you take advantage of the game\u2019s replay feature. Get the top score, fulfil the secondary objectives, find new ways to kill each Bad Guy, and work on your murder skills.\nSHOW OFF your killing prowess and achievements to your friends, and prove that you are the world\u2019s top justice seeker.",
