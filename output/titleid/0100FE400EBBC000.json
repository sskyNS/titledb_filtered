	"description": "You are invited to join \u201cThe Primate Observation Club\u201d, where you will observe the lives of caged monkeys and carefully analyze the information obtained.\n\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS:\n\nTHE PRIMATE OBSERVATION CLUB: a shadowy group that observes other people through surveillance cameras and compromised webcams.\nYOU: the newest member of the CLUB, tired of your run-down apartment, dull existence, and boring job.\nMONKEYS: dozens of strangers who have fallen prey to your surveillance.\nPRIVACY: Something that the monkeys think they have.\nPC (PERSONAL COMPUTER): Yep, we put a PC in your game that\u2019s on your Nintendo Switch\u2122 so that you can work on a PC while you\u2019re playing the game that\u2019s on your Nintendo Switch\u2122 console!\nFEEDING THE MONKEYS: Interacting or interfering with the subjects in any way. Feeding the monkeys is strictly prohibited.\n\nOddly enough, club members keep feeding the monkeys as though they just can\u2019t abide by this very simple rule! How about you? Will you help those you\u2019re spying on, extort them, expose them and sabotage their dreams, or will you follow your instructions and sit twiddling your thumbs while the world burns?",
