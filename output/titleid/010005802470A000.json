	"description": "\"Xak: The Tower of Gazzel,\" released by MicroCabin in 1991 in Japan, is a top-view action RPG. As indicated by the lack of a numbered title, it is officially considered a side story. However, it still features Latok as the protagonist, along with familiar characters like Frey and Pixie, and is set one year after \"II.\" In that sense, playing the first game beforehand might enhance the experience.  \n\nThis time, Latok sets out to conquer the mysterious and monster-infested Tower of Gazzel. As a side story, the game introduces a slightly unique system within the series. Notably, there is no level-up system, meaning players don\u2019t need to spend time grinding for experience points and can focus purely on progressing through the game. Instead, character power-ups are obtained through items.  \n\nAnother standout feature is the support member system, where players can choose an adventure companion. There are five support members, each with unique abilities\u2014Pixie excels in healing and trap disarmament, while Frey specializes in magic. Strategically switching members based on the situation is key to success. If you find yourself stuck, trying a different companion might be the key to progressing.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
