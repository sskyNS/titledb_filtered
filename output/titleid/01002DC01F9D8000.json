	"description": "Description\n\nEl Panadero is a 2D hand drawn action platformer. You play as a Mexican baker, armed with nothing but his fists and dough throwing skills. \n\nEl Panadero -The Baker- is a one man take on 90's cooperative coin-ops. Rough action, adventure, comedy and horror. The gameplay draws inspiration from countless platform action classics while keeping it simple. The Music features creations from Tokyo Based producer Ghostpops, Mexican Lo-Fi sensation Palmasur, and City-Pop mixer Neko Milkshake.\n\nHistory\nThe Blue skies of the Mexican Bajio were pierced by a sudden attack from an empire of man eating vines, vile vegetable things from OUTER SPACE.\nThe protagonists find themselves with nothing to lose after an alien attack destroyed their bakery, their home. The invaders ate their friends and infested their city. \n\nThey lost everything, but still have something to offer: VIOLENCE.\nTheir weapons: their burning soul and bodies forged by years of making the best darn bolillos on town.\n\nFeatures\n- Hand drawn locales, pastry, animations and nightmares.\n- Eclectic choice of music.\n- Concise gameplay. Simple controls. Straight to the point action.\n- Old school replayability. Each run takes around 40~60 minutes.\n- Local co-op.\n- Animated violence.\n- Varied locales, from a colonial city in central Mexico, to the innards of a lettuce-like spaceship.\n\n* Co-op requires two full  controllers. Tabletop mode requires one full controller per player.",
