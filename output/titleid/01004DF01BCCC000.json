	"intro": "This 2D platform game where we manage our little character will make you feel different from the platform games you know! In this game where we progress chapter by chapter, we are trying to reach the places requested from us by using the pipes extending from the ledges or trying to catch the keys placed in certain places.  As you progress, not only the distance the pipes have to travel increases, but also the pipes are in different colors and need to be placed according to the correct color design, making your game more difficult but more enjoyable! Taste the different and varied level designs and try to progress with the right strategies!\n\nUse the right strategy to get through the levels that get more complicated as the map grows! \nChange your character's color as the level and pipes dictate and try to get the keys placed in certain places in the shortest way possible!\nChanging color palettes and atmospheres from level to level will give you a different experience in every level! \nThe quick restart option allows you to quickly restart levels and search for different paths!",
