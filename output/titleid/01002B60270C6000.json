	"intro": "The epic conclusion to the Mugen no Shinzou series. After escaping the Dream World, the warrior\u2019s long-awaited homecoming is cut short by a new, unforeseen trial!",
	"description": "Originally released by Crystal Soft in 1990, this classic RPG follows the series' tradition of seamless storytelling. Just as \"II\" picked up right after the conclusion of the first game, this title begins the moment \"II\" ends. The story starts with a veteran warrior, who has survived countless adventures in the Dream World (Mugen-kai), finally returning to the nostalgic sights of their home world.\n\nThe game features a top-down perspective with symbol encounters (on-screen enemies). Players will form a party of up to four members to explore the world. While the protagonist is human, the potential allies are incredibly diverse\u2014ranging from familiar races like Elves and Dwarves to formidable beings like Dragons and Giants. In a unique mechanical twist, equipment is tied to Race rather than Class, making your party composition a vital strategic choice. Upon reaching Level 13, you can select specific abilities to undergo a Class Change, with certain paths unlocking even further advanced classes at higher levels.\n\nCombat utilizes an intuitive Auto-Battle system. Victory depends on the clever use of physical attacks and various magic spells. Defense is particularly effective against physical strikes, and mastering its use is the key to surviving tough encounters.\n\nAs a series highly regarded as a foundation of the Japanese RPG (JRPG) genre, it offers a grand narrative that is best experienced in its entirety. We invite you to take this opportunity to play through the series and witness the origins of the JRPG.\n \n\n *The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n *Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
