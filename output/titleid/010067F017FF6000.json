	"description": "Without any inventory, the player has to solve puzzles to make their way in this world, gathering information and fundamental elements to get their soul back into the body, using only the power of possession they received as a pure soul.\n\nHistory\nTwo lovers, Daphn\u00e9 and Luca, decided on a short break in Venice, Italy. Shortly after arriving at the apartment they rented, they are suddenly pulled apart, tricked by a demon called Buer.

He will have to find his way back to Daphn\u00e9 and his own human form, solving puzzles and using whatever he can to get back to his life: notes, books, spirits he will encounter, decor, and even Buer's (partial) information.\n\nFeatures\n\u2022 No inventory\n\u2022 Different powers to unlock with puzzles, including the Power of Possession\n\u2022 5 areas to explore in a non-linear way\n\u2022 80 unique rooms\n\u2022 Brand new story and characters\u2026 and maybe some you already met in Goetia!",
