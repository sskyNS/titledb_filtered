	"description": "Quickly run into the gap as the ceiling comes crashing down from above. If you make it in time the ceiling will rise up again and then crash down again and again, each time with the gap in a random place. How long can you survive?\n\nIf you can squeeze into the yellow Exit area you'll earn coins that you can use to buy new costumes.\n\nTest yourself in 4 intense game modes:\nEndless Run, 100-to-1 Sole Survivor, Vs CPU Head-to-head, and Challenge Mode with 150 quick fire stages!\nThere's online rankings too so you can compete with others around the world for the best scores. \n\nThere's also a 2-4P local multiplayer mode so you can go up against your friends to see who is the best ExitMan/Woman! It's squid-like survival drama!",
