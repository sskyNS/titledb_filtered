	"intro": "An innovative edutainment game that teaches you Japanese through virtual photography!",
	"description": "Explore bright, fictional Japanese streets filled with details and interesting objects to capture with your camera. Each photograph you take will translate the name of the content into Japanese and English so you can learn with your surroundings.\n\nFeatures:\n- A stylised, approachable 3D environment\n- In-game photography system\n- Japanese audio\n- Photo album to store your flash cards\n- Game modes that test your memory\n- Beginner phrases and grammar lessons\n- Day/Night and weather cycle\n- Display romaji, kana, furigana (recommended) or kanji\n- A lo-fi soundtrack perfect for studying with\n\nCreate Stunning Photography Based Flashcards\nEvery photo flash-card you take will be unique to you. The idea behind this is to strengthen the relationship between a word and how you see its physical appearance. In the real world, you can then see such objects and make connections to the Japanese words you've already learned while playing Shashingo.\n\nTrack Your Progress in the Photo Album\nYour photo album is where you keep your collection of Photo Flash-Cards. If you remember them well in Find Mode, they'll be separated into the 'mastered' tab and shown with a gold star sticker. However, if you're struggling to remember a word in Find Mode, they'll be marked with a purple exclamation mark sticker, so you know which words you need to practice more.\nYou can also mark your favourite words & images with a cute little heart sticker to add them to your favourites page.\n\nAt the back of your in-game photo album, there are numerous pages of Japanese lessons designed for beginners that will teach you how to speak Japanese and use the vocabulary that you learn in Shashingo. Also included are some key words and important phrases that can help you in your future conversations.",
