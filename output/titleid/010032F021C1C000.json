Players observe planets (or metal spheres?) running along rails and switch points to direct them to their designated positions. With 30 stages in total, it offers plenty of gameplay value! While simple, this masterpiece delivers the best of action-puzzle fun.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
