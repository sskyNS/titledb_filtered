	"description": "Angelo and Deemon: One Hell of a Quest is a classic point and click adventure game! \n\nA lightning strike ignites a breathtaking chain of events, and a blogger follows the Grim Reaper to Hell.\n\nAngelo\u2019s channel suffers from a lack of likes and views. He needs them. At any cost. Deciding to record his journey to another world with the Grim Reaper, he hopes he can create the most trending, most liked, most hyped video of all time.\n\nUnfortunately for Angelo, that world is Hell. And it\u2019s inhabited by people with more than a few problems, who will need his help.\n\nMake a visit to the Devil himself! But be careful because... well\u2026you'll see.\n\nIn Hell, Angelo won\u2019t be traveling alone. Even a blogger needs a sidekick. \n\nWhat you can expect:\n\u2022 Expressive and somehow slightly familiar characters\n\u2022 A helluva great looking game with lots of levels, but no pixel art!\n\u2022 Addictive and mind-blowing puzzles. This game makes you think (unlike other games)!\n\u2022 Not pixel art graphics! (in case you missed the line above)\n\u2022 Funny dialogue. A cocktail of humor and philosophy; delivered in snappy soundbites! \n\u2022 Too much cocktails are harmful, so our lines are sophisticated. Making you smile and think at the same time by using only a few words (like now)\n\u2022 You won\u2019t forget these characters\u2019 lines, even if you try. Each character has their own issues. (Who doesn\u2019t have issues, right?)\n\u2022 WARNING!!! There is a chance you\u2019ll like it in Hell and won\u2019t be scared anymore",
