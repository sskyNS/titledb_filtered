	"description": "Exploding into the modern era like a pro wrestler from the top rope\u2014it\u2019s Gex! The fast-talking gecko who doesn\u2019t want to sell you insurance! That\u2019s right, the greatest gaming hero of the 1990s has returned for the 2020s through the raw, unbridled power of the Carbon Engine. \n\nGex Trilogy reproduces all three original games in exacting detail, precisely the way you remember them. Assuming you\u2019ve gone senile and remember them having high-definition native 16:9 widescreen visuals and fully analog controls. Which they didn\u2019t. No, this is the Gex series the way it was meant to be played. The Man didn\u2019t think you were ready back then. He kept this version locked away. But the moment has finally arrived. Down with The Man! Up with Gex! Gex Trilogy is Gex, the next-gen version. The Gex\u2019t-gen version. The Gexiest version of all.\n\nAnd just like the tightest red carpet attire on Oscar night, the Gex Trilogy is totally stuffed\u2026 with tons of bonus features, including a music player featuring every track from each game (even the tunes that are kind of annoying), a massive museum filled with key art, a collection of classic TV commercials for the media-addled idiots in the audience, and an all-new interview with the voice of Gex. \n\nThat\u2019s Gould, Jerry, Gould! (Dana Gould, to be precise.)\n",
