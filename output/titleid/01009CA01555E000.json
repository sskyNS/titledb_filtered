The pages within were blank.\nIn truth, Mariel had heard the name, \u201cAbyss\u201d from the elder angels before. It was the name of the world below the heavens.\nIntrigued by the notion, her curiosity grew until she couldn\u2019t resist any longer. She ventured out to the heavenly bridge to sneak a peek over the edge, into the world known as \u201cAbyss.\u201d \nHowever, when she peered down into the depths\u2026\n\nMeet the challenge with intuitive drawing action!\nThe basic controls are simply \u201ctouch\u201d or \u201cjayro.\u201d\nProtect, connect, aid, and guide Mariel with your Joy-Con\u2122.\nMariel will continue to walk in a single direction. Draw paths with your Joy-Con\u2122 and aid Mariel on her adventure through the Abyss.\n",
