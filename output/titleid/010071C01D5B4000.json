	"intro": "RUBATO, an experimental, 2D physics-based take on the collect-a-thon genre!",
	"description": "The year is 12,012. Multiquadrillionaire monopoly \"GSSAI CO.\" has been in power of the universe for centuries after a world-ending bioweapon was unleashed onto the masses. And now? The solar system has been destroyed by unknown celestial forces. A weapons development program run by the Earth subsidiary of \"GSSAI CO.\" is fast progressing. And the world's denizens are disappearing.\n\nThat is until one man screws up a game of pool.\n\nHERO OF THE STARS AND THE SKY\n\u25cf Use your tongue to lick enemies and objects as you make your way through open metroidvania-like areas, whilst collecting \"Planet Bits\" to help fix the solar system!\n\nWELCOME TO RUBATO WORLD\n\u25cf 5 compact, densely packed areas ranging from a huge sprawling bakery to the world's most poorly planned city. Uncover secrets and shortcuts in every corner of the world.\n\nIF I COULD ONLY LOVE\n\u25cf A strange, funny plot with a deep focus on humour and character writing. It gets silly. It gets serious. Really concerningly serious. Uh. Is the guy who made this game okay..?\n\nBUT FIRST, LOVE YOURSELF\n\u25cf To save the world, you must save yourself first. Find yourself again.",
