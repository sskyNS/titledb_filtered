	"description": "Boxville 2, from Triomatica Games, is the next part of an adventure game about cans living in a box city.\nTwo can friends had an important job from the mayor to set up fireworks for the city's celebration. But due to a mistake, the fireworks went off wrong, causing chaos in the city. Worse, one of the friends went missing. Now, the main character, a red can, has to explore different areas and secret spots in Boxville and even travel outside the city to fix everything and find his friend.\n\nWhat you can expect to see and hear in Boxville:\n- Hand-drawn graphics \u2014 all backgrounds and characters are carefully drawn by our artists.\n- Every animation and sound is created especially for each interaction.\n- Unique music track was created for every scene to accomplish the atmosphere of the game.\n- Tens of logical puzzles and mini-games are tightly incorporated into the story of the game.\n- There are no words in the game \u2014 all characters communicate via cartoony sketches.",
