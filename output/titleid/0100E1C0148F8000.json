Features 42 levels, each with their own sub-challenges, and over 20 unlockable, game modifying 'Mutators'.\n\nCampaign Mode - Blast through six compact story chapters as you battle against the forces of nefarious mega-corporation, EdenSys.\n\nAccessibility - A range of adjustable settings for features such as difficulty, visuals, audio, controls, navigation, and more.",
