It doesn't matter, your responsibility is to the shareholders!\n\nFeatures \n\u2022 Deep RPG Mechanics\nChoose from 7 unique hero classes to make up your squad of 3. The more action they see the more XP they earn to level them up through custom skill trees.\n\u2022 30+ active abilities\n\u2022 40+ passive skills\n\u2022 Multiple armor options with stats to suit your play-style\n\n\u2022 You want billions of weapons?\nWell we dont have that many but... we've put a lot of work balancing the the 30+ we do have along with 12 tower types and 6 different damage types.  \n\nWe're sure HEROCORP\u2122 has got the hardware to ensure you can wreak havoc in your own personal style. \n\n\u2022 More enemies than you can poke a boom stick at \nThe range of enemies in OTTTD is wide enough to soothe even the itchiest trigger finger. Floating eyeballs? Check. Gunclams? You know it. Giant Wartoises? Of course.
