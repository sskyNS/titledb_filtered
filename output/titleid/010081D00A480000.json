	"description": "Ninja Striker takes visuals and music inspired by the 8-bit era and fires them up with modern touches. Heavily stylized around Japanese themes, your goal is to advance forward with as much speed, flair and combo power as possible. You have double jumps, homing attacks and a special \u2018Shinobi Action\u2019 at your disposal; only by mastering each with sharp reflexes will you make it through your quest.\n\nYou can choose between four characters, each with different abilities, and dash through a range of stages and Boss encounters. Each character changes up the way you play, meaning there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had in battling through the campaign with each warrior. \n\nNinja \u2013 This deadly fighter has a Spinning Slash attack and \u2018Storm Attack\u2019 special.\nKunoichi \u2013 She carries plenty of threat and should not be underestimated, with a Spinning Shot attack and \u2018Kunai\u2019 special.\nChain Sickle \u2013 This mysterious fighter\u2019s unique style gives him incredible range, with a Chain Attack and \u2018Sickle Slash\u2019 special.\nRobot Ninja \u2013 Slower than his human counterpart but with more health points and the ability to boost through stages, this metallic warrior has a Drill attack and \u2018Hammer Attack\u2019 special.\n\nWith catchy music, varied locations and increasingly dangerous foes, Ninja Striker will keep you coming back for \u2018one more try\u2019. Boost and fight your way through for the highest combos, with maximum rankings of three stars per stage reserved for the most skilled of players.\n\nAre you up for the challenge in Ninja Striker?",
