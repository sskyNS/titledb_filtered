	"description": "Backrooms: Poolrooms ...\u00a0The Poolrooms hold secrets that should never be uncovered...\n\nStrange deaths are plaguing the Poolrooms, and now it's your turn to investigate the horrifying mystery. Bodies have been found floating in the endless, dimly lit pools, their faces twisted in terror. The Poolrooms are no ordinary place - something dark and deadly has taken root, and it's not alone.\u00a0\n\nStrange entities have infiltrated the area, stalking you through the water-soaked halls. But they are not like any creature you\u2019ve ever encountered. These entities are invisible, only detectable by the faintest splash they leave behind. As you search for the required things scattered throughout this nightmarish maze, you must be careful, as every step could reveal your position.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the entities you need to watch out for. The waters are teeming with fish, their movements sending ripples through the pool and alerting nearby horrors to your presence. Every splash could be the last sound you ever hear. If you\u2019re too careless, your position will be compromised, and the deadly entities will be upon you.\n\nCan you survive the horrors lurking in the Poolrooms, or will you become another lost soul drifting beneath the surface? Time is running out... and the waters are rising.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Investigate the Poolrooms: Explore an eerie, endless labyrinth of pools, flooded hallways, and chilling environments filled with mystery and danger.\n\n* Invisible Entities: The creatures haunting the Poolrooms are invisible to the naked eye. Track them by their splashes and keep a careful watch on your surroundings.\n\n* Dangerous Fish: Watch out for fish lurking in the water - their splashes will give away your position, making you vulnerable to the entities hunting you.\n\n* Tension-filled Atmosphere: A nerve-wracking sound design keeps you on edge, amplifying every footstep, splash, and movement in the darkness.",
