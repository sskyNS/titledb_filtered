	"description": "\"Lady & Lonely Boy \uff5e\u304a\u5b22\u69d8\u3068\u307c\u3063\u3061\u304f\u3093\uff5e\" is a school comedy visual novel about a protagonist who becomes the only male student at a school attended by young ladies. The story follows him as he teaches the girls, who know nothing about men, what it means to be a man.\nA Bishojo Game released in 2013 under the \"Swaneye\" brand has been reworked for the \"PandaShojo\" platform for players around the world to enjoy.\n\n\n\u25c6Synopsis\nHolding his sharply aching stomach, Takumi Kiba stopped in front of the school gate.\nEven though he was late, why didn't he just go through the gate and head to the classroom?\nBecause there are girls in the classroom! Girls! Girls! It's only for girls!\n\nTakumi didn't expect that there would be no other male students besides himself, and he ended up feeling isolated at the academy.\nWhile living such a lonely life, Chika Kagei, his childhood friend and the only person he can talk to, invites him to join a club.\n\nThe club was called the \"Communication Club\", commonly known as the \"Garden\".\nAs girls' schools became co-educational, it was established to act as a mediator between men and women and to resolve problems between them.\nThat's what Garden Chairman Hibiki Ayasegawa said.\n\"Would you like to be friends with us?\"\n\nHe really wanted male friends.\nBut for Takumi, who was lonely and wanted to quit the school, these words were the sweetest of all.\nTakumi decides to join the Garden.\n\n\"Welcome to the Garden!\"\n\n\n\u25c6Characters\n\u30fbHibiki Ayasegawa\n\u201cWe, the female students of this school, have very little interaction with men.\u201d\nA young lady who excels academically, is beautiful, comes from a good family, and serves as the head of the Garden.\nHowever, she is arrogant and hates losing, and she even challenges Takumi.\nThere are many aspects of her that are endearing, such as being somewhat absent-minded and unable to defy Himeko.\n\n\u30fbHimeko Ranjou\n\"Sorry about that. It's the first time a boy has come, so everyone got a bit carried away...\"\nA polite and stylish young lady, a third-year student like Hibiki, who serves as the student council president.\nShe is very kind to Takumi and the members of Garden, and everyone looks up to her.\nQuite clueless about dirty jokes, and a shy person who turns bright red and says, \"That's inappropriate!\"\n\n\u30fbYuzu Ogino\n\"What? What do you mean I don't look like an upperclassman?\"\nA second-year student who is not good at sitting still and has a rich variety of expressions showing joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.\nFor some reason, she often arrives at the clubroom first and end up talking with Takumi until everyone else shows up.\nIf someone picks a fight with her, she's quick to take the bait, so quarrels suddenly erupt.\n\n\u30fbMiyu Sasazuka\n\"Wearing onions around your neck... or sticking it in your butt is good too \u266a\"\nA natural airhead with outstanding style and a younger sister-like atmosphere.\nLike Takumi, she is a first year student who entered this year and got to know him after being introduced to him by Chika.\nInnocent and sincere, eager to please, but not very bright.\n\n\u30fbChika Kagei\n\"Alright! Hey, Miyu~! Let's go buy a new swimsuit~!\"\nSince long ago, his childhood friend with a peculiar constitution often causes clumsy accidents involving water.\nShre has a good understanding of Takumi and cares about him being lonely.\nOn the inside she's kind of acts like a man, and has a direty sense of humor that can rival Takumi's.\n\n\u30fbTakumi Kiba\n\"(No, I don't want to...I want to quit the school...)\"\nThe only male student who enrolled in the newly coeducational 'Saint Principal Academy' this year.\nIn a harem-like state, there is no way to settle into a space where only girls exist.\nJust when he was considering dropping out soon after enrolling, he was invited to join the Garden.",
