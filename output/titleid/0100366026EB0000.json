	"description": "Monkey in the Zoo puts you inside the mind \u2014 and mischief \u2014 of a monkey behind bars. The real attraction isn\u2019t you\u2026 it\u2019s the unpredictable humans who wander up to your cage.\n\nSome visitors arrive with smiles and snacks.\nOthers come armed with loud voices, pushy attitudes, or questionable intentions.\nHow you react \u2014 playful, curious, or gloriously chaotic \u2014 shapes every moment.\n\nGrab whatever you can reach.\nEat it, throw it, break it, or offer it back with suspicious kindness.\nYour cage is a fully interactive playground, and every visitor becomes part of your improvised story.\n\nFrom harmless comedy to tense standoffs, no encounter is ever the same.\n\nYou may be behind bars \u2014\nbut you decide who\u2019s really in control.",
