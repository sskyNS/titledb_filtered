Help Emma and the teddy bear Fenton solve the mystery of the disappearance of the famous magician Thomas Kane.\n\nAward-winning Tandem: A Tale of Shadows features five beautiful Victorian-inspired worlds inspired by Tim Burton, Jules Vernes, Conan Doyle. Players have to carefully alternate between Emma\u2019s top-down view and Fenton\u2019s horizontal side-scroller view if they hope to escape these chiaroscuro dimensions alive.\n\nAs the duo navigates past intelligent obstacles and menacing horrors, they uncover clues regarding Thomas\u2019 disappearance, the strange Kane family, and their place in this universe. Will Emma and Fenton escape the murderous manor filled with twists and turns, or has their fate already been sealed?\n",
