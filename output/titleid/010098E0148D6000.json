Simple problem solving - General Battle\n2. Quick-fire questions where you have to guess the right answer - Special Magic Time\n3. Solve three questions and enter them in order of numbers - Final Boss Battle\n\nRyn uses three  types of magic.\nEarth magic deals physical shock.\nIce magic blocks enemies behind you.\nFire magic deals damage to enemies in front of and behind you.\nMagics can be upgraded to Level 3, switch between them according to situation.\n\nEven the explanation looks difficult, huh?\nThere are three levels of difficulty in Dragon Question.\nThe lowest difficulty level was created easy enough even for elementary school students to enjoy.\nBut just because it's called 'easy' doesn't mean it is a piece of cake.\nEach wave and stage will have ever-changing difficulty, so you can feel a great sense of achievement when you complete it.\nIt has been designed to improve math skills while providing a challenge with a sense of achievement.\nThere are also normal and hard difficulties, for users who have general mental arithmetic skills and those who are skilled in mental arithmetic respectively.\nIn addition, there are also modes where you can practice addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nWe hope you enjoy getting to know math with Dragon Question.",
