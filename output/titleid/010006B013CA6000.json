Your main task is to eat given slice of bread. Pigeon which will eat the most pieces of bread, wins!\n\nPigeon Fever\n\nMode is made for people who like to chase each other. One of Pigeons is infected, your job is to give this infection to another Pigeon by pecking somebody (like tag game). But look! Your points are decreasing! When your points counter hits 0, you are being caged to the end of match. Last free pigeon wins!\n\nPigeon Kingess\n\nHave you ever seen a Pigeon with bread on it's neck? This mode is exactly about it! Your target at the start of a game is to wear a crown by pecking it, then when you have the crown you HAVE TO RUN because other pigeons can take it off from you and wear it. You gain points by holding the crown!\n\nCapture The Bread\n\n2 teams with up to 4 pigeons each!\nMain task:\n- Steal bread crown from enemies base!\n- Bring it to yours\n- ???\n- Profit!\n\nPoop Point\nLike in Capture The Bread, there are 2 teams again. This time your team has to poop a given point. Team which will poop the point most will get a point!\nObviously team with max points amount wins!\n\nMovie Editor\n\nSandbox mode! You can set your pigeons, set scenery and do stuff!\nPlay animations, change styles and do your own theater!\n\nMany locations to fight!\nYou can defecate and slip on pigeons poop.\nSmart AI that behaves like stupid pigeons (very smart behaving like dumb).",
