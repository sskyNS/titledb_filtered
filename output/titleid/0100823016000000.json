	"description": "Dance, hands free, to great music and learn new incredible moves! The system can do full-body tracking thanks to artificial intelligence!\n \nTry the demo on your Nintendo Switch\u2122 and install the Musical Vibes Camera app on your smartphone to see if you can use the camera of your smartphone to play the game. See the requirements at the bottom.\n\nMusical Vibes features 2-player local multiplayer. Dance with one of your friends by your side!\n\nIf you own a Philips Hue smart lighting system, connect it to the game and turn your living room into a concert hall! Bring the fun to another level!\n\nIn this first version, you can play one track for free in the demo. 2-player local multiplayer is only available in the paid version. The paid version of the game includes at least 8 music tracks. This game page may not always be updated with the most up-to-date information. Please try the demo to know if more tracks are available in the full game.\n\nFor the times you don't want to dance or if you don't have a compatible smartphone, you can play the rhythm game mode instead. In this mode, you must press the correct direction on your controller at the right time, while following the music. Since you simply have to use your controller, it means you can also play Musical Vibes wherever you want in this mode!\n\nMore features to be announced soon.",
