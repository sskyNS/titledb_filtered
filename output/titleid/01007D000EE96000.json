	"description": "\u2500\u2500We cannot choose in this unfair world.\n\nHao-Chen Jiang did not understand what it was when he opened his eyes. Before him was a dim and dreary room that he had not seen before. Trying to get up to turn on the lights, he finds that his arms are tied behind him and that is when he realizes that he's been kidnapped. It is then that a mysterious girl appears before him and with a look of disdain tells him that he's been kidnapped and unless his family agrees to pay a ransom he has no chance to escape. But perhaps there is more to this than just money...\n\nThe rich boy stuck in his never changing daily life...\nThe fierce girl struggling for survival...\nTwo people in totally opposite positions in life.\n\nDuring his days of imprisonment, they will learn of a world they were never aware of which will crumble away at their deep-rooted prejudices. In the face of confusion and the choices before them, what will they find...?\n\nA Light in the Dark is an original visual novel game from the creative minds of CreSpirit, Storia and Narrator. Featuring interactive elements to push the story forward, examine your surroundings and formulate a plan to escape but beware of your stamina!\n\nThis edition of the game also features the voice talents of Kubo Yurika and Ichinose Kana as the voices of the older girl and the younger girl.
