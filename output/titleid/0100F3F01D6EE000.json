	"description": "One of the most influential visual novels of all time, and a school love story like no other. This remastered release comes with a brand new, easy-to-use interface. The game contains the first two arcs: Extra, and Unlimited.\nDon\u2019t fall for Extra\u2019s cutesy exterior. This series ventures into some of the darkest thematic territory you\u2019ll ever see, and when the final curtain closes, you\u2019ll need a forklift to pick your jaw up off the floor. Make no mistake: this is a story that will challenge you in ways few works of fiction dare attempt, and an emotional tour de force unlike any other.\n\n----Muv-Luv Extra----\nTakeru is your average high school senior whose entire world gets turned upside down one morning when he awakens to find himself in bed with the heiress to one of the world\u2019s largest conglomerates. She calls herself Meiya, and - despite never having met him before - she insists that the two of them are destined for one another. This comes much to the chagrin of his childhood friend Sumika, the girl next door who\u2019s always had feelings for him, who realizes that if she doesn\u2019t act fast, she might just lose him forever. But just who is Meiya? And do his feelings for Sumika run deeper than he thought? In the end, he\u2019ll need to decide between the girl who\u2019s been with him through thick and thin, or the stranger who claims they\u2019re bound together by fate. \nBut that\u2019s only one side of the story.\n\n----Muv-Luv Unlimited----\nJust as the page turns on Takeru\u2019s happily ever after, he awakens one morning in a world not his own. An alternate timeline, a world infested by alien invaders locked in a war that\u2019s been raging on for decades. And yet, all the set pieces are the same - his house is still here, albeit barely standing. His school is still here, though it\u2019s now a military academy. And even though they don\u2019t recognize him, all his friends are here too... with one exception...",
