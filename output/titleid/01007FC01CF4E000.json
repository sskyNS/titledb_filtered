	"intro": "You are Shin, a demon hunter. Battle demons, regain lost skills, and uncover the truth of your forgotten past in this occult-inspired cyberpunk metroidvania.",
	"description": "You are Shin, a demon hunter with no memory of his past. After striking an unusual partnership with Lux, a demon with the ability to shapeshift into a sword and manipulate time, you begin a quest to learn what happened to you and your loved ones. Fight brutal battles against terrible demons. Explore a corrupted and dangerous world. Regain what was once yours.\n\nGameplay Overview :\n- As the Demon Sword, Lux offers a wide array of utilities. She can perform powerful attacks and shield you from harm, but also act as a platform and even restore objects that were once lost. Use your demonic companion to traverse and survive in a desolate, demon-ridden Osaka.\n\n- As Shin defeats demons and levels up, new skills can be unlocked via skill tree. Unlock the \"Warp\" skill to travel anywhere on the map or a double-jump to get up to higher ledges and explore new locations with ease.\n\n- Lux isn't the only weapon in your arsenal. In addition to his main firearm, Shin can wield other weapons such as greatswords and whips. Experiment with a variety of armaments and create your own style of combat.\n\n- Enjoy the latest metroidvania from Team Ladybug, the team behind such acclaimed titles as \"Touhou Luna Nights\" and \"Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth\".\n- Explore a map far larger than past Team Ladybug projects, filled with side quests that both deepen your connection to and expand upon the world of \"BLADECHIMERA\".\n\nThe Story :\nIt all began with the sudden appearance of a ghastly demonic horde. Humans fought against ghouls and ghosts in what would later be known as the \"Demon War,\" and the world was changed forever.\nThirty years later, using their expertise in combatting demons, a religious group called the \"Holy Union\" has carved out a small but stable enclave of survivors.",
