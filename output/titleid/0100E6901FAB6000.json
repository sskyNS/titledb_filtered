	"description": "Do you miss the good old days when games weren't holding your hand? Then you're in the perfect place. In Jupiter Hell - Action follows your every move. When you act, your enemies act. But when you die. You die for good.\n\nJupiter Hell lets you become a hero in a classic 90s-flavored sci-fi universe. It's you and your trusty shotgun (or chaingun, railgun or even a chainsaw) against hordes of demonic and alien enemies. All to the shine of CRT monitors. Just like in the good old days. But the graphics are much better.\n\nUnlock new perks, test out new builds and try to live through the hell you have ended up in.\nEvery run is different, thanks to the procedurally generated levels. Earn new perks. Build your character to endure what lurks around the corner. If you manage to survive the Jupiter Hell - you can unlock new challenges. It's not gonna get any easier. Quite the contrary. It's gonna make you suffer.\n\nDoes 20+ years of experience making top-down, cosmic-hell roguelikes sound like a recipe for a hell of a good turn-based roguelike?\nChaosForge team, the developer of Jupiter Hell, gained recognition for creating Doom, the Roguelike (known also as DRL.) They built the Jupiter Hell as a spiritual successor to DRL.\n",
