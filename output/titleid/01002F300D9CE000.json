	"description": "A helicopter crash left a group of explorers stranded near an Arctic research station. The survivors will have to resist the nightmares of dead frost and hunger. As they try to escape the dangers of the long dark polar night and find the way to the shelter of the abandoned station, all they are doing is sinking deeper into a nightmare scenario. \n\nWhen they fall asleep, they attract a terrifying force that sucks the life out of their bodies, but the longer they battle exhaustion and stay awake, the less likely they are to survive. Guide the explorers through a randomly generated station, overcome the severe climate and fight the unfathomable!\n\nMYSTERIOUS ANOMALIES WAITING IN THE WINGS\n\nThey come out of nowhere and disappear instantly. They may be faster than light or may crawl slowly till they get near enough to strike. What are they? What do they want?\n\nTHE ENDLESS NIGHT AND EXTREME CLIMATE\nExplore and research the abandoned station, gather and craft the tools and open the supply boxes so you don\u2019t starve from hunger and cold.\n\nPROCEDURAL GENERATION\nA randomly generated base turns every new playthrough into a unique adventure.\n\n15 SURVIVORS TO CHOOSE FROM\nEvery character has unique skills and abilities to fit any survival strategy of yours.\n\nAN ABSORBING NARRATION WITH TONS OF PLOT TWISTS AND QUESTS TO COMPLETE\nWhat is that force that inhabits the station? Is that an alien from the outer space or a mythical ancient creature from the from the depths of the centuries? Or is that a result of a failed scientific experiment? Survive to learn the answer!\n\nALTERED PERCEPTION OF REALITY\nAs the explorers try to sleep just enough to stay alive, they slowly go mad and eventually reach the point where they can no longer trust their senses and tell the difference between reality and a hallucination.",
