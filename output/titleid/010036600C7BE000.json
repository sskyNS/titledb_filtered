	"description": "Discover a unique hand-drawing art style, humorous characters and a variety of fun gameplay mechanics.\n\nTHE WORLD\nDoodland is a grotesque world created on a piece of paper. It is invaded by Omnomus, a cruel monster that loves the taste of inhabitants of this land. Each part of the world has a unique atmosphere. You will have to run, jump, swim and fly to overcome many demanding obstacles.\n\nDOODLERS\nDoodlers are peaceful and brave creatures living in Doodland, choose which one you will help to escape. There are no two same Doodlers. Each of them looks different and sounds different, but every one of them has one common feature - digestive problems.\n\nBOOSTERS\nOmnomus has no mercy. If you are on reach, he will eat you without blinking an eye. Fortunately Doodlers can use their gastric problems against him:\nJust find a match, light your fart and feel the boost.\nAnd if this won't help, just release stinky gases in his face to stun him. This is your last resort.",
