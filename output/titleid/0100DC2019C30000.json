	"description": "In a not-so-distant yet dystopian future the world's energy crisis has only worsened and the few remaining resources still available to be harnessed are in remote and inhospitable locations. The world has switched from oil and gas to a new resource pumped up from deep under the earth's surface. Albeit this highly radioactive gas is far more powerful then other fossil fuel sources it has a nasty side effect. Toxic and deadly to humans without hazmat suit it also caused mysterious and grotesque mutations in previously harmless species. These critters grew to enormous proportions and developed a crude form of intelligence bent on destroying all of the human efforts to turn the radioactive gasses into usable fuel.\n\nHere comes the solution: risking the lives of too many heroic young technicians already the humans started to train and arm the pipeline crews to defend & repair the instalations. With the help of a potent arsenal of destructive weapons and precision engineering resulting in deadly gun towers, the brave technician-soldiers can do their job with at least a healthy 2% chance of survival... (up from 0,000002% before).",
