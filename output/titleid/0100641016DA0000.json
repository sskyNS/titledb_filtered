	"description": "REDO!  is a dark, lonely, evocative, non-linear action RPG. \nDrawing inspiration from the works of Tsutomu Nihei and Lovecraft, REDO! is a game about a girl trying to find what\u2019 remains of a dystopian world overrun by biomachines. \nPresented in a non-linear, open format, the game provides a dark and mysterious narrative within a gloomy and vast, interconnected decaying city. \nCombat is methodical, with the player needing to balance staggering enemies \u2013 making them less of a danger and an easier target \u2013 against fighting furiously to deplete their health as quickly as possible, and survive both unique enemy encounters and unforgiving environments. \nIn order to survive in this world after the end of mankind, the player will have a diverse selection of weaponry and items available, ranging from energy blades, to riot shields, to rocket launchers. \nThe twisted biomachines which inhabit the lonely world of REDO! breathe fire, electrify air and spit plasma. You will need every tool available to survive.\n\nKey Features:\n    -Deep, cryptic, and mysterious lore left behind by the last remnants of humanity\n    -A diverse array of weapons and items, each with their own utility\n    -A vast, open-ended sprawling metropolis, and dying world to explore\n    -Over a dozen terrifying, twisted and unique enemy types\n    -Brutal non-linear action RPG with Dark Souls inspired gameplay, emphasizing a balance of lethality and stamina\n    -7-12 hours of gameplay",
