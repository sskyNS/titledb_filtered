It was awarded the Best Upcoming Game at IMGA in San Francisco in March 2017.\n\nThe main character, professor Vincent Cornelius Moore, fights robots that invaded the city of Steamburg. The gameplay is unique \u2013 Vincent is unarmed, so he must choose his moves wisely. He can only throw small electro-bombs which lure the robots and halt their progress for a while. Vincent has to walk through the streets in such a way that the robot chasing him hits upon a Tesla coil and is destroyed. It seems quite easy in the first levels.
