	"description": "This Action RPG was released by COSMOS COMPUTER in 1984. The hero Perseus embarks on an adventure to rescue the Goddess of Beauty on a magical island ruled by the Gorgon.\n\nYou increase health by defeating enemies and acquiring items. True to the Action RPG style, combat involves bumping into enemies. The enemies you can defeat depend on your current strength, requiring you to identify and defeat them in sequence.\n\nThe game clears by obtaining either all 12 Zodiac items or three Goddess statues. Though it has a unique learning curve, this masterpiece pioneered the domestic Japanese Action RPG genre and is highly recommended.\n\n \n *The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n *Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
