	"description": "Do you have it? In GUTS, you can take part in the legendary sports-action show and compete in classic events to test your mettle before you reach the radical rock itself - the Aggro Crag!\n\nRocko's Modern Life: Spunky's Dangerous Day is a unique puzzle platforming game where you have to guide Spunky out of harm's way. The game takes you across sixteen hazard-filled levels and locales inspired by the show itself. You might even run into some of O-Town's most well-known residents.\n\nFinally, in\u00a0AAAHH!!! Real Monsters, you get to take direct control of everyone's favorite monsters - Ickis, Oblina, and Krumm! Both versions are included, so you can leave the console wars in the '90s and re-experience the game on your preferred 16-bit machine!\n\nIn addition to the games themselves, several extra features are included:\n\n-Rewind: Made a mistake? Don't worry! You can rewind to try again.\n-Save Anywhere: Need a break? Bring up the menu and save your game whenever you want.\n-Music Player: Just want to listen to the great music in these games? We've got you covered!",
