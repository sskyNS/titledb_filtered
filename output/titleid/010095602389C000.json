The letter bears a chilling message: \"Do you wish to be free from your nightmares? We await you...\"\n\nThe next day, the mystery deepens with the arrival of a second note revealing the name of the village: \"Y. Village.\" Unsure of who beckons him and wary of potential dangers, Batu gathers a group to venture to the village. However, as they approach its boundaries, they're confronted by an unsettling figure in a gas mask, instilling fear in the group. All but Batu are consumed by terror, for he claims he cannot see this person. Believing his friends to be hallucinating from fear, Batu presses on.\n\nNow, only one friend remains by Batu\u2019s side as they journey into the village. They're welcomed by Hasan, a hospitable local. Everything seems ordinary until Batu awakens in the night to a piercing siren, revealing the village's true horrifying nature. For his friend is no longer in bed and has vanished.\n\nCan Batu locate his friend, unravel the village's mystery, and escape? What has drawn Batu to this village? What secrets await to be unveiled in the village? In this village filled with mysteries, what startling conclusion awaits Batu?",
