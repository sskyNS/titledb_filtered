	"description": "Journey into a fantastical world on a quest for revenge in DRAGON QUEST MONSTERS: The Dark Prince. \n\nPsaro is cursed and is unable to harm anything with monster blood. Now, he must become a Monster Wrangler to create an army for battle.\n\nThe hunt for high-ranked monsters takes Psaro through the ever-changing seasons of Nadiria and its unique environments, with rivers of bubbling lava, mysterious ancient ruins, and soaring towers of cake. Along the way, Psaro meets the kind-hearted elf, Rose, who joins his adventure to seek out ever-stronger monsters.\n\nThe key to Psaro's success lies with synthesis: the ability to combine two monsters and create a stronger offspring. Each new creation brings Psaro one step closer to his goal of becoming the Master of Monsterkind.",
