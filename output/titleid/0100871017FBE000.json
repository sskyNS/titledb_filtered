How embarrassing.\nYou decide to swallow your pride and knock the door for help. \n\n\u201cMaybe a house this size might keep fuel for sit on mowers and generators.\u201d You think, hopefully, to yourself.\n\nMoments after knocking on the door your world turns black and you find yourself waking up in the basement, reading a note left by the owner:\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have found yourself waking up here but you were snooping on my property and I was alerted to your presence. \n\nI will be back shortly. \n\nYou will find the door to your room locked.
