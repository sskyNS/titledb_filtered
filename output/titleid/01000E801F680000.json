	"description": "Besiege is a physics-based building game in which you construct medieval siege engines and lay waste to immense fortresses and peaceful hamlets. Build a machine that can crush windmills, wipe out battalions of brave soldiers, and transport valuable resources, defending your creation against cannons, archers, and whatever else the desperate enemies have at their disposal. Create a trundling behemoth, take clumsily to the skies, and cause carnage in fully destructible environments. Ultimately, you must conquer every Kingdom by crippling their castles and annihilating their men and livestock, in as creative or clinical a manner as possible!\n\nBesiege Nintendo Switch\u2122 Edition contains:\n- Touch Screen Support\n- 4 Singleplayer campaign islands with a total of 55 levels for you to conquer\n- 3 Sandbox level environments for you to perfect your creation & test it out against the locals\n- Over 70 blocks and a complete set of building tools to help you construct your genius machines of doom\n- A Time Dilation Slider allowing you to slow down time during those epic crashing moments\n\n",
