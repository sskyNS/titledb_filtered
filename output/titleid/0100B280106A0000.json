	"description": "Take yourself back to 1848 in Aviary Attorney: Definitive Edition. Paris is on the brink of yet another revolution, and the prisons are overflowing with guilty and innocent alike.\n\nOne bird stands for justice amid society's chaos.\n\nPlay the role of Monsieur Jayjay Falcon, a bird of prey with a good heart and questionable lawyering expertise. Join him and his witty apprentice, Sparrowson, as the two take on clients, interview witnesses, collect evidence and deliver justice to the guilty.\n\nWith art by 19th-century caricaturist J. J. Grandville and music by legendary romantic-era composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, this game promises to be a ~swanderful~ experience.\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Definitive edition graphics. These beaks have never looked so sharp!\n\u2022 Four chapters of talon-biting intrigue and suspense.\n\u2022 Three fully fleshed-out endings. Decisions have consequences!\n\u2022 Dozens of colorful characters to meet, interview, and bribe.\n\u2022 Did I say bribe? I meant persuade.\n\u2022 Real-life landmarks. Knock on the doors of Notre-Dame! Loot the Louvre!\n\u2022 Optional dyslexic font. No one has to miss out!\n\u2022 Earn medals to show everyone you're the fanciest bird around.\n\u2022 Visit the art gallery and see the characters in their natural habitats.\n\u2022 Try the jukebox! Listen to a romantic era soundtrack that spans from Hector Berlioz to Claude Debussy.\n\u2022 More bird puns than you can shake a feather at.",
