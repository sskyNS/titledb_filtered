	"description": "In Mage Arena: Voice of Power, every battle is fought not with buttons, but with your own voice. Speak with precision, command mystical forces, and watch as your words shape reality in the arena. Your voice is the key to unleashing devastating attacks, shielding yourself from harm, and bending the fight to your will.\n\nStep into a living, ever-changing magical island where arenas shift and resources abound. Gather rare materials, craft powerful tools, and outthink your rivals as you climb toward ultimate mastery.\n\nYour mission? Breach enemy strongholds, seize their flag, and prove your dominance in the ancient feud between mages and warlocks.\n\n(And yes, yelling random words at your screen is now officially \u201ctactical.\u201d)",
