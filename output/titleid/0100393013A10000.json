	"intro": "Timothy it\u2019s an \"old school\" style title with some modern-age ideas. A mix of retro graphics along with meta-narrative, stealth system action combat!",
	"description": "Timothy, a common child, wants to save his grandfather from certain death. The old man fell ill and he's now fighting for his life. Timothy, who loves his grandfather very much, decides to take a risky journey to the infamous Mysterious Forest. Legends speak of a magic mushroom able to cure any disease that grows into the forest. Timothy bravely begins his journey to find the magic mushroom.\n\n\nThe game mixes elements from adventure/exploration games with puzzle and stealth: exploration, reading and keeping a slow pace is the best tactic. The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps.\n\nThe world is full of ruins, graveyards and tombstones, caves, swamps and weird characters: every place is made to look wild, abandoned and dangerous. Except for Timothy's grandfather, most characters are often mean or clearly driven by not-so-nice feelings.",
