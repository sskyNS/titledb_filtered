	"intro": "Play as a turnip with a big juicy bum delivering mail to a cast of colourful characters on an Australian island. Get the mail where it needs to go by reading residents' letters!",
	"description": "The best part of delivering mail? You can open every single letter and look through everyone\u2019s business! Whilst in the real world this is a crime, on Arralla Isle it\u2019s perfectly acceptable, and even encouraged!\n\nAt the Arralla Isle Deliberry service, you'll have to solve where each letter goes through pictograms drawn on each envelope - and they're not always obvious!\n\nLearn of the island residents' interpersonal problems through reading their mail - they will need your help to resolve them! Meet big booty cutie fruits like grouchy glassblowers, silly scientists, and deliver seriously creepy letters to an ominous house on a hill...\n\nOn Arralla Isle, there\u2019s no rush. The pace is slow, like a lazy summer day, so you can relax while you play. Exploration is a treat in this beautiful Australian landscape.\n\nSnap photos, kick over chessboard pieces, read about Arralla Isle's history, throw stuff, discover secrets. The island is your oyster. You can even call your mum!\n\nThere's plenty to do as a mail delivery turnip on Arralla Isle!",
