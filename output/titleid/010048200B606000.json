Bean, Engineering Corps, \nTop of his class, the fastest runner of our Glorious Army. Equipped with a personal Energy Repulsion Shield, capable of deflecting the most devastating of blows! Scout Bean loves flowers, and beans.\n\nMajor B. Bob, VI Assault Division,\nImplacable marksman with a fervent passion for our cause, chocolate, and ballet! Major Bob may move slower, but no Martian will be quick enough to run away and tell the tale.\n\nBase Building\nOur Explorers hold all the necessary blueprints for efficient on-site mining operations and base building including Automatic Extractors, O2 Generators, Armories, Single-Barrel and Double-Barrel Automatic Defence Turrets, and the most important of them all, our Glorious Flag! \n\nA Campaign to Remember\nThe Masterful Invasion Plan we envisioned is divided in 9 Missions. Our conquest will be swift, sure, and certain! But, in case the pitiful Martians manage to put up a fight due to their sheer number, we are also prepared to entrench and endure an Endless warfare.\n\nIt will be glorious! Mars, or Die!",
