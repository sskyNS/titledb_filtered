	"description": "Wake up at The Gateway, confront the mirrors, and close the 6 eyes of the demons keeping you imprisoned! This is a fast paced rouge-like shooter, with a combat system that forces every bullet and move to matter. \n\nIn this game, shooting is based on a turn timer which you can influence. Every time you dash, or kill enemies the turn timer will move faster. Playing fast and reckless will allow you too attack very fast, but careful not to be too reckless! Missing bullets will slow down your timer. \n\nIn order to face a demon, you will need to clear 3 randomly generated islands. Which are guarded by monsters. Survive islands with the help of perks and upgrades. These will help you become more and more powerful the further you get. With infinitely stacking perks and your own skills, the monsters will have a hard time stopping you!",
