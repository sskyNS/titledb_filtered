	"description": "\"THE LAST BLADE\" is a fighting game released by SNK in 1997, set in Japan\u2019s Edo period with a roster of unique swordsmen to choose from.\n\nThematically the game is similar to the \u201cSAMURAI SHODOWN\" series, but also features a wealth of innovative systems to set it apart. One such system is the ability to choose between \u201cPower\u201d and \u201cSpeed\u201d styles when selecting a character. The \u201cPower\u201d system focuses on high damage while the \u201cSpeed\u201d system focuses more on intricate combos and speed. The game also features a unique \u201cHajiki\u201d ability that allows players to deflect or repel attacks. The game also allows the player to cancel super attacks into Desperation Moves adding another strategic element to the game. Finally, the game features a wealth of flashy attacks thanks to the inclusion of Super Secret Skills and Super Desperation Moves.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\n\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\n\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.\u3000",
