	"description": "Break blocks, grab powerups, solve puzzles, and beat bosses! When a mysterious tower appears in the forest, Chico the Chipmunk and his new friend Beeatrice decide to go exploring. In the tower they'll find a whole host of block-breaking challenges, clever environmental puzzles, and secrets to be unraveled! How can a tower appear out of nowhere? The answers are waiting inside.\n\nIn the block breaking Rebound challenges, you'll be tasked with clearing every block from the stage by bouncing around Chico's trusty giant walnut. Keep a long volley going to get a high score! Chico can change the angle of the ball by tail-whipping it while he runs, to give you control over your shot. It's simple to start but takes skill to master!\n\nOf course, it's not always so simple. There are over a dozen types of blocks, and different power-ups for the walnut that change how they interact. Fire power burns grass blocks, spikes smash through blocks with ease, explosive power breaks stone, and much much more! Fans, cannons, ghosts, and more turn each level into a unique challenge! It's block-breaking like you've never experienced it before.\n\nIn between block breaking challenges you'll explore the mysterious Celestial Tower, a large interconnected dungeon full of environmental puzzles! Explore all 6 floors of the tower, unlock new paths, and make your way to the very top! You'll meet a cast of characters who need your help, as they try to complete their secret mission. Can you solve the puzzles, uncover the truth of the Celestial Tower, and save the day?\n\nHave fun and show off your unique style! Save up the sunflower seeds you collect, and you can trade them in for special designs for both your walnut and the game's interface! Why not bounce around a watermelon or a paper lantern instead of a walnut? There are a bunch of colors and styles to choose from.\n",
