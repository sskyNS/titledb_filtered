	"description": "Deck of Ashes is an adventure game with tactical card combat. In this complete edition of the game an elven archer Sibyl the Dark Soul joins the cast of antiheroes on their quest for redemption. As Sibyl, use superior sharpshooter skills, resurrect fallen enemies or induce Fear and Hysteria in everyone who oppose you. One character at a time, explore the cursed fantasy world and hunt down powerful cards. Put your survival and resource management skills to the test when upgrading your Camp of allies.\n\nThe choices that drive your journey - where to go, which resource to collect, which risk to take, and which card to craft - are the difference between success and untimely demise.\n\nCan You Rid the World Of the Ash Curse?\n\nDynamic and Dangerous World\nDeck of Ashes features a procedurally generated world where danger waits around every corner. Sudden ambushes, cataclysms, and random events will force you to constantly adapt and explore fleeting opportunities to gain an edge! Refine your strategy on the go to ensure your survival!\n\nDeck-building Done Right\nThe players are provided with a handy set of deck-building tools. For newbies - there are ready decks of cards that obviously work together well. And if you are ready to go crazy with your own deck ideas, there are 100+ cards for each character to explore and combine into unexpected combos!\n\nUpgrade the Camp to Meet Your Needs\nDifferent strategies require vastly different upgrades of your Camp. The resources are scarce, and you won't be able to improve everything in one playthrough, so choose wisely!",
