	"description": "At the boundary of light and darkness, there existed a world called Rune Worth. Once, everything was born, flourished, and perished there\u2014even the gods were no exception, it is said. The tale of EA=Rune Worth, which is about to be told, begins with the birth of the absolute god, Eatils. Yet, even this is only a small fragment of the many stories that should be told in Rune Worth...\n\nThis action RPG was released in 1989. Players take on the role of a young traveler, journeying through the world of Rune Worth, gradually becoming entangled in a grand adventure. At first glance, it may seem like a conventional action RPG, but it is packed with unique features.\n\nFor example, level-ups occur through events and items, meaning battles with enemies can be kept to a minimum, allowing players to purely enjoy the story. Spells require casting time, and if the player is attacked during casting, the spell is interrupted. Even small actions, such as opening treasure chests or crouching, have dedicated character animations. These elements come together to create a distinctive RPG experience.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
