	"description": "A World After the Machines Came\nOn Lana and Mui\u2019s home planet, new technology brings progress but also stirs greed and imbalance. As different tribes adopt it in their own ways, tensions grow and the world\u2019s harmony begins to shift. When those seeking power push too far, Lana and her little companion are pulled into a journey that reveals long-buried truths about their planet and about themselves.\n\nA World That Tells Its Story\nJourney across frozen peaks, deep oceans, and forgotten ruins in a hand-painted world where nature meets technology.
