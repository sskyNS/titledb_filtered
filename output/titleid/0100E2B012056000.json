From the Dropoff Depot and the Shipping Floor, all the way to the Telegraph Desk and the Cassowary Coop out back, the Telepost is a well-oiled mail-processing machine...well, usually. \n\nOvercome Occupational Hazards:\n\nBrave inclement weather (and even weirder stuff) while waddling through the Telepost\u2019s various mailrooms to ensure the residents of Bungalow Basin get their post. From swirling sandstorms and blizzards, to carnivorous plants and paranormal activity, it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work for Jeff and Debra.\n\nTeam Up or Be Your Own Boss:\n\nTake control of both Jeff and Debra, and test your post processing skills in single-player mode, or team up with a friend to tackle mailroom mayhem in online and local co-op modes.

You\u2019ll earn Stamps at the end of each postal shift, which can be used to unlock new wardrobe accessories to customise Jeff and Debra, making them the best-dressed mail birds in Bungalow Basin. Get creative with hats, facewear, backwear, hairstyles and feather patterns \u2013 there's no dress code at the Telepost!\n\nKeep an Eye Out for Collectibles:\n\nAll sorts of weird things have fallen into the nooks and crannies of the Telepost over the years, and curious kiwis can solve hidden puzzles to find Collectibles that reward special cosmetics.\n\nExperience More Mayhem with Overtime Shifts:\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget you can earn Stamps from doing extra chores at the Telepost. Feed and exercise the cassowaries, plug up the leaky pipes in the basement, make sure the bubble wrap supply is quality controlled and build colleague morale with winter snowball fights; these are just some of the exciting overtime adventures that await!\n\nGet Exclusive Wardrobe Items Only on Nintendo Switch\u2122:\n\nGo medieval on the mailroom with our exclusive knight outfit \u2013 only on Nintendo Switch!
