There\u2019s over 100 different combinations you can try out to suit your playstyle!\n\nA MEAN STORY\nACE THE ASSISTANT will loop you into the 50 handcrafted levels of bullet hell action. The bosses will taunt you as you lose, but if you persist you will rise up the ranks, progress the story, earn GRIND POINTS and unlock new ways to play!
