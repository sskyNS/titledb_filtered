	"description": "Enter the hall, where the mind unravels and reality distorts.\nYou're lost in the sterile halls of a psychiatric hospital. The corridor seems endless, but something is wrong\u2014objects shift, things are not as they should be, and the deeper you go, the more unsettling the anomalies become. With every step, you feel an unsettling presence growing closer, as if the hospital itself is hiding something from you.\n\nRULES:\n- Don't overlook any anomalies.\n- Turn back immediately if you notice one.\n- Go forward if you don't notice any anomaly.\n- Go out of the hall.\n\nPay close attention to every shift in the corridor. The smallest change might unlock a piece of a forgotten past, leading you deeper into a dark and twisted story. What seems like a harmless difference could be the key to uncovering the truth you\u2019ve buried. Miss it, and you might remain lost in the madness forever.",
