	"description": "This is a action game released in Japan by Carry lab in 1984. Players infiltrate a quarter-view prisoner-of-war camp, battling enemy soldiers with limited-ammo grenades and pistols. Use acquired keys to open cells and rescue comrades.\n\nRescued allies may move unexpectedly, but \"Gather\" and \"Scatter\" commands help them escape effectively. Escaping with five allies completes the stage. Total 16 stages. Losing five allies to friendly fire or other incidents during infiltration results in mission failure.\n\nThis comical escape unfolds across unique, Escher-like stages. It's a simple yet satisfying game.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
