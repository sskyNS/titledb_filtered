	"description": "Stranded by the sea. Surrounded by danger. Driven to survive.\n\nAfter a violent storm destroys your ship, you wake up alone on a remote tropical island. With nothing but the wreckage around you and the ocean full of unknown threats, survival becomes your only goal. Every resource matters. Every dive is a risk. And escape is not guaranteed.\n\nIn Island Survival 2026: Craft, Build, Grow, you must explore both the island and the depths below the water. Search beaches, jungles, reefs, and sunken ships to gather materials, craft essential tools, and slowly build everything you need to stay alive. Hunger, thirst, storms, and predators constantly test your endurance, while limited oxygen turns underwater exploration into a race against time.\n\nTo escape the island, you must construct a boat piece by piece \u2014 hull, sail, and rudder. But the final blueprint lies hidden deep inside a sunken ship, guarded by sharks and dangerous currents. Only by crafting better equipment, managing resources wisely, and pushing further into the unknown can you claim your way home.\nSurvival is not about speed. It\u2019s about preparation, courage, and learning from the world around you.\n\nKey Features\n\n- Island survival gameplay with crafting and resource management\n- Underwater exploration with oxygen limits and environmental threats\n- Boat construction as the main progression goal\n- Dynamic survival systems: hunger, thirst, storms, and hazards\n- Semi-open world with beaches, jungles, reefs, and shipwrecks\n- Story elements revealed through exploration\n\nSurvive the island.\nBuild your escape.\nLeave the ocean behind.",
