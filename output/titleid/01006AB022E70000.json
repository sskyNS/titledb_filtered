Will your sins be forgiven, or your soul consumed by madness?\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nDistinctive dark comic-like visuals\nDark hand-drawn graphic design where every frame looks like a page from a comic book is one of the pillars of Forgive Me Father, and the sequel brings a fresh perspective to its unique style with improved sprites, models and atmospheric lighting effects. Prepare to feast your eyes on juicy blood effects and animated gibs flying everywhere!\n\nDive into the madness\nDefeat Lovecraftian nightmares with a wide range of weapons.
