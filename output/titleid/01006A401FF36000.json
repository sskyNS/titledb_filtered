	"description": "\"Dragon Slayer,\" a flagship series from Nihon Falcom, saw its sixth installment released in 1989 in Japan as the command-type RPG \"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes.\"\n\nWhile the \"Dragon Slayer\" series was known for its innovative game systems, this entry took a significant turn, focusing on captivating scenarios and world-building. The gameplay is very straightforward, featuring a traditional encounter system and command-based combat, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience. This new system was highly popular and eventually led to the series continuing under the title \"The Legend of Heroes,\" dropping the \"Dragon Slayer\" name.\n\nThe story is set in the world of \"Elasta,\" blessed with abundant nature. The small but peaceful Kingdom of Farlane, ruled by the wise King Asuel, is suddenly attacked by a horde of monsters, leading to the king's unexpected death. The protagonist, Prince Selios, is the rightful heir to the throne, but until he turns 16, the king's close aide Agdam, who witnessed the king's last moments, serves as the regent. The story begins ten years later, just days before the coronation of the now-grown Selios...\n\nThe PC-8801 version, the original \"Legend of Heroes,\" was released ahead of other platforms. Its beautiful graphics and sound, showcasing Nihon Falcom's technology at the time, remain impressive and worth experiencing compared to later versions. Enjoy the original \"Legend of Heroes\" in its purest form.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
