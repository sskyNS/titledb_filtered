Two teams (1v1 or 2v2) battle across a full\u2011field arena inspired by fast\u2011paced sports play. Each team\u2019s goal sits in a corner and is protected by five shield segments arranged in a pentagon around the goal circle.\n\nHit shield pieces with the ball to break them and open a scoring path.

Teams defend their entire side of the screen as their goal, with five shield segments arranged vertically to block incoming shots. A black hole and no\u2011cross barrier divide the arena, keeping each team on its own side.\n\nShoot the ball near or through the central black hole to bend its path and dramatically increase its speed, creating high\u2011risk, high\u2011reward plays.\n\nMETEOR SHOWER\nPlayers: 1\u20132 CO\u2011OP\nGo solo or team up with a friend to climb the online leaderboard. Defend your shared goal using five shield segments arranged along the bottom of the screen. Two balls are active at all times, and you must shoot them into falling meteors and enemy objects descending from above. Destroy enemy objects in quick succession to build up your score multiplier.\n\nIf an enemy hits a shield, that shield is destroyed. If an enemy slips through a gap into the goal area, the run ends. Survive as long as possible, build your multiplier, and push for a new high score.",
