Is it chaotic retribution, or the machinations of beings beyond our comprehension?\n\nThis is WORLD OF HORROR: The end of the world is nigh, and the only solution is to confront the terror reigning over the apocalypse. Navigate this hellish, roguelite reality through turn-based combat and unforgiving choices in this roguelite-style cosmic horror RPG.\n\nInvoke dark rituals, uncover disturbing clues, and solve puzzles across multiple randomized mysteries.

Lovecraft.\n\nStart your investigations by choosing from 5 unique characters, with many others to be unlocked. The darkness surrounded Shiokawa conceals over 20 different mysteries to be encountered in each run, with each mystery harboring multiple possible endings. Complimented by a haunting chiptune soundtrack and a stark 1-bit art style drawn 100% in MS Paint, WORLD OF HORROR  comes together to present a gnawing sense of dread.",
