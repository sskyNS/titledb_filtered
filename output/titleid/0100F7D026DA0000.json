	"description": "This story follows the transformation of the city of Aeros, where a forced partnership between a teacher of light and a gravity expert leads to the discovery that their world\u2019s perfection is actually a fa\u00e7ade of control and manipulation. As the protagonists move beyond their differences, they must choose between maintaining an artificial order or embracing a painful truth that threatens to destroy their old loyalties. Ultimately, the tale explores how true stability isn\u2019t born from imposed purity, but from accepting duality and the honest coexistence of opposites.\nAn interactive storybook experience. A linear narrative adventure, perfect for young readers to enjoy a captivating story at their own pace.",
