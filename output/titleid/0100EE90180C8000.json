	"intro": "While the bakery might initially be broken down, overgrown and even haunted, don\u2019t worry! You\u2019ll be able to repair, furnish and decorate every room in the bakery. Gather honey from your beehive, raise a cow to collect fresh milk and adopt a few chickens to add eggs to your recipes. You\u2019ll also be able to grow trees and plants to harvest a variety of fruits. \n\nMix ingredients together to prepare all kinds of recipes, including baked pastries, candies and frozen desserts! Be sure to serve your customers quickly and keep your window display well stocked so you don\u2019t miss out on any order! Serve coffee to impatient customers to keep them around the bakery a bit longer and build an adorable cat cafe to make everyone\u2019s day brighter! \n\n",
