	"description": "This game is a shooting game released in 1986. The game screen is presented in a side view, and the weapons are limited to just shots, making it a simple gameplay experience.\n\nAn essential aspect of this game is the unique power-up system. There is a gauge at the bottom of the screen, and when you collect numeric items dropped by enemies, the lamps on the gauge move to the right by the number you collect. Depending on where it stops, your shot changes. The interesting part is that moving to the right does not necessarily mean a stronger weapon, and you need to instantly assess the numbers and contents of the gauge. If you fail to power-up, you may end up weakening.\n\nThe game is also known for its high difficulty level. It's a game with some quirks, but it is undeniably satisfying to master. With 32 stages to conquer, put your skills to the test and enjoy the challenge!\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
