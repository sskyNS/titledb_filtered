	"description": "All players approach games in varied ways, making different choices.\nNo one ever plays in exactly the same way. Indeed, how a person plays can be an indicator of their personality...\nAnd Refind Self is a game where you can learn all about that personality.\nOne play is about one hour.\nJust enjoy this simple test during your busy time.\nAnd the third time test will show all your personalities, where the end of the story is also not far away.\n\nStory:\nYou are an android. The story begins with you standing at the grave of the Doctor who created you. The world is populated by robots in various forms, created for numerous purposes.\nTravel to places key to your memories of the Doctor, interact with the robots, and unravel the secrets behind the future the Doctor sought and what you were entrusted with.\n\nHow to Play:\nGo wherever you feel like, converse, investigate, play minigames... Simply play as you please. There are no game overs, and there's no right or wrong way to progress.\nWith each action you take, your personality will be analyzed. Once analysis is 100% complete... Congratulations, you've beaten the game! Your personality results will then be revealed.\nIf you want to know more about your personality, you can go back to play again and again. Of course, this also goes for those who want to know the truth of the story.\n\nPersonality Comparison and Sharing:\nYour test results are stored in an online database, and you'll be issued a unique results ID. You can share your results ID, and view others' results to compare them with your own.\nPerhaps similar personalities mean good compatibility? That's another way of having fun with your results.",
