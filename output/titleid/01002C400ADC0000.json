	"description": "We will venture forth with Kiara in a Celtic adventure, exploring different maze-like procedurally generated worlds. We will face enemies in frenetic battles where we will have to make use of our reflexes and choose between different abilities to beat the menacing creatures. Lift the curse upon the kingdom of Bamba and find out why you are the only one not frozen in time.\n\nCeltic Ambientation\nLost King's Lullaby brings us a new point of view of the celtic culture, taking a lot of traditional elements of this culture and rediscovering it.\n\nTale esthetic\nBe amazed by a beautiful art style inspired by Tomm Moore' Song of the Sea and The Secret of Kells. You will feel like you are falling into a tale...\n\nAlternative Battle System\nFight in frenetic battles  where your reflexes and tactical thinking will play a big part. Customize the way you want to battle by choosing your abilities and buffs.\n\nProcedural World\nYou will be always surprised by our procedural woods. Each time you run your adventure you will encounter new routes and paths, enemies and treasures.\n",
