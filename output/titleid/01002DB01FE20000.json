	"description": "Far beyond the golden sands, there once was a bloodline that ruled over Arguice. This is a tale from long ago. The winged ones descended upon the hills of Ateparu, where they entered an eternal slumber alongside the spirits of wind, earth, and water. After thousands of seasons, when calamity arises once more, the descendants of Arguice, wielding wings and swords, will vanquish the demons...\n\nThis RPG was released in 1988 in Japan. The player embarks on an adventure to save the world from the threat of demons as the 23rd prince of the Kingdom of Arguice.\n\nTowns and dungeons are presented in a side view, while map navigation is shown in a top-down view.The game is lightweight and most actions can be performed using the numeric keypad, making movement and exploration feel like an action game.\n\nCombat uses a semi-auto battle system with random encounters. You will watch your character and the monsters fight, issuing commands as needed based on the situation, resulting in a very immersive battle experience. Be vigilant, as inattentiveness can lead to dire situations.\n\nOne of the game's attractions is the included \"Book of Wyverns.\" This booklet contains materials for decoding dungeon murals encountered during gameplay, as well as detailed monster descriptions. Spanning nearly 100 pages, it provides a rich and engaging read.\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
