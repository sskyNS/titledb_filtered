	"description": "Ritual of Raven is a cozy, story-based farming sim - but you don\u2019t do the farming yourself! Instead you collect and enchant Arcana Constructs to grow your magical herb garden.\n\nIn a world where different traditions of magic live side by side, ambitious plans were made to open portals between worlds, but the ritual went terribly wrong. Those involved each lost something most precious to them and the portals became unstable, randomly spitting out new arrivals into the world.\n\nAfter falling through one of these mysterious portals yourself, you encounter the local witch Sage, who decides you\u2019re the best person to help her in her quest. Taken under her wing as an apprentice, you\u2019ll be able to help search for her missing Familiar, Flufferstoop.\n\nWith your cheeky Familiar Raven by your side, you\u2019ll gather the knowledge and ingredients to perform powerful rituals. Fill your Book of Shadows and find the Portal Keepers to bring stability to the portals that have been causing trouble for the village.\n\nEnchanting Arcana Constructs\n\nDid you know, harvesting lavender with your hands completely destroys its magical properties? Fear not, that\u2019s why Arcana Constructs are there to do all your magical gardening for you! Using a mystical deck of cards, you\u2019ll be able to enchant them to plow, sow seeds, water and harvest them for you. Collect all 22 Constructs and create a thriving herb garden.\n\nMeet your new neighbors\n\nMake friends with the quirky community of outcasts and help them grow closer to each other. Get to know their unique backstories and trade with them for valuable ingredients.\n\nMoon... Magic!\n\nLearn how your harvest changes in each moon phase and use the moons power to charge your crystals. Discover how to command the moon phases to suit your needs at the moon shrine. There\u2019s a lot more to the moon than meets the eye.\n\nDecorate your world\n\nAfter finding yourself in a brand-new land, it's important to make it feel as homely as possible. Take a trip to Pistachio\u2019s and get creative with their stock of out-of-this-world furniture to decorate the village and your farm.\n\nComplete your collections\n\nLet your Construct extract and fuse lots of different crystals, fill the library and throw your fishing claw into the portals to pull out artifacts from different worlds!",
