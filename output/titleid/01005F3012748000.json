	"description": "Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials is a snarky action-adventure puzzle game with a good dose of humor. Explore hundreds of secret-filled rooms, fight big bosses, gather companions for your party and use the powers of Pip -your bat buddy- to solve puzzles and escape the eldritch abyss!\n\n*Crash* ...That was the sound of you landing face first in an abyss filled with monsters, traps, and eldritch secrets. But hey, it's ok barbarian, you are not alone: Pip, your best friend -and mysteriously luminous bat- is with you. And it's only by truly working together that you'll be able to solve the abyss' puzzles, fight off its hungry denizens, discover its true purpose and maybe -just maybe- make it out alive with the secrets of the primordials.\n\n\nKey Features\n\n- Gain new skills for your barbarian and elemental powers for Pip, the (magic) bat!\n\n- A narrative-driven metroidvania with dialogue choices and plenty of humor and snark.\n\n- Big numbers! 400+ rooms, 20+ hours of evolving gameplay, 10+ boss, 60+ minutes of music and almost 30,000 words of text that a barbarian would never bother to read!\n\n- Puzzles.\n\n- RPG elements with a level-up minigame.\n\n- Contains more fruit throwing than probably any other game.\n\n- Companions that join you in your quest and help you out in fights.\n\n- Multiple endings based on your choices and actions.\n\n- The thrown fruits are NOT wasted, they are eaten by the bat (who is magic).\n\n- A ton of secrets and hidden loot just about everywhere.\n\n- The (magic) bat has a whopping FIVE different squeaking sounds!\n\n- Fewer repetitive jokes than this description has.",
