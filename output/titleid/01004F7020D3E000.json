	"description": "Thrills and Speed for Ultimate Excitement! Oh no! A few people have been left behind in an underwater city. If they aren\u2019t rescued quickly, they\u2019ll be blown up by mines or missiles. You must lift them to the surface on the rescue ship and reach the waiting mothership as fast as possible. \n\nThis is a shooting game released in 1983 in Japan. The player controls a rescue ship to embark on a mission to save lives from the underwater city.\n\nBetween the mothership and the underwater city, obstacles are placed, and occasionally, missiles will be launched towards the underwater city. To make matters worse, you can only transport one person at a time, making the rescue operation anything but easy.\n\nSkillfully avoid obstacles, counter missile attacks with your barrier, and don't forget to keep an eye on the remaining fuel for your rescue ship. If you manage to bring five survivors back to the mothership, you clear the stage. Despite its simple rules, this game offers a fast-paced and thrilling experience that keeps you on your toes.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
