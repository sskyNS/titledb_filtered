	"intro": "\u201cI never cared about this ship...I just\u2026wanted to find myself. I had to. Something deep in my brain \u2013 deep in my very soul \u2013 clawed at me, struggling to make sense of everything. But the sad truth is that it never could. I never could. I still can\u2019t remember who I am.\u201d\n\nHello, prospective crew member! Welcome to Shakhter-One, the first space mining ship to gather resources from the atmosphere of the planet Jupiter! Shakhter-One provides mass quantities of supplies to a resource-starved Earth. Thanks to Shakhter-One, we no longer have to depend on coal or oil! Still not sold on making Shakhter-One your new home?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if this has happened before. Me, here, telling this same, exact story. \u2026Surely not. I would remember that\u2026 Right?\u201d\n\nShakhter-One offers a fresh start among the stars! On Shakhter-One, everybody is important! Everybody is employed! All children have an equal start! We\u2019re confident you\u2019ll see that Shakhter-One is the perfect place to begin your family\u2019s future!\n\n\u201cThe only thing that I can truly be sure of is the constant, pervading feeling I have deep inside. I\u2019m empty. I\u2019m hollow.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cHollow,\u201d you are one of the pilots that transports precious resource cargo from the mining ship Shakhter-One down to Earth. One day you wake up in an emergency capsule drifting near the facility. You don\u2019t remember who you are, or how you got out there\u2026 All you can remember is an autopilot docking code for capsule dock NR 6.\n\nWhen you dock with Shakhter-One, it is clear that something has gone horribly wrong. The crew is missing and the entire facility is dealing with catastrophic power issues. As you start to uncover the ship\u2019s terrifying secrets, Shakhter-One threatens to take your identity, your sanity, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 your life.\n\nThe worst evil is the one that knows us better than we know ourselves.\nThe worst nightmare is the one borne in our past, emotions, fears, and pain.",
