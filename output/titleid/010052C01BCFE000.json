	"description": "Unpogable is a 2D platformer all about precise platforming!\n\n\nYou'll not only use one pogo stick to navigate through each level, but two! It's not as easy as it sounds. Unpogable will challenge all your platforming and pogo skills.\n\nThe huge campaign level will teach you all the necessary skills you need to succeed! It starts easy and gets more difficult the further you get, just like life. Falling can mean a huge loss of progress, so be careful!\n\n\nOnce you're ready, you can try completing the daily challenge levels! It's a new level every day, randomly generated and the same for every player! Or, use your own seeds to generate levels. The perfect feature to challenge your friends to a race!\n\nYou can see your stats at the end of each level. Copy your stats with the press of a button and share them on Social Media platforms to flex with your super awesome Unpogable skills.\n\n\nWant to customize the look of your game? You can customize the color of every single object. Player, environment, one-way-platforms, slippery platforms, almost everything. You'll unlock new colors by collecting Qubs in the daily challenge levels.\n\n\nYou play as a \"Pog\". The Pogs are caught in an endless cycle of climbing to reach the Star to ascend to Elysium.  Not many Pogs can make it to Elysium. But maybe you can?\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Will you seek the Star or fall back to earth?\n\nPlay Unpogable now and find out!",
