	"description": "Welcome to the Underworld\u2014a land of monsters and mutants who eat humans for breakfast.\n\nOne such monster\u2014a hulking ogre by the name of Roy\u2014has no interest in eating humans. But one day, he and his best friend Golan stumble upon a lost little girl named Meg, and discover something truly terrifying: the moment she starts wailing in fear, a blood-red hue washes over the sky, and the earth itself begins to tremble and quake.\n\nThat\u2019s right: this small girl\u2019s tears hold the power to bring forth the apocalypse\u2014and the only way to stop it is for them to help find her mother so she can make it safely back home.\n\nMeg\u2019s Monster is a short, story-driven JRPG with a big twist. Players control Roy, who begins the game with 99,999 HP and is virtually untouchable\u2014but the real concern is keeping Meg safe, because if she starts crying, it\u2019s game over for everyone. Players will have to master the unique mechanics and mini-games baked into each battle, all while protecting Meg and using her favorite toys to keep her pacified.\n\nOver the course of their journey together, Roy and Meg will encounter a host of quirky and colorful characters, all lovingly rendered in Odencat\u2019s trademark vibrant pixel aesthetic that makes even scary monsters look cute. There\u2019s plenty of drama and intrigue to be found here\u2014and even previously defeated enemies can be befriended through optional sub-events.\n\nWhat begins as a relatively simple and heartwarming story about two unlikely friends ultimately expands into something much greater, as Roy and Meg slowly begin to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Underworld and themselves. The result is an emotional journey that, like any good storybook, will remain in your heart for years to come.",
