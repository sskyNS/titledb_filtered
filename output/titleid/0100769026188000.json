	"description": "YellowPips throws you straight into the heart of the Wild West. Build an impressive town with services like a barber shop, hotel, bank, armory, and a grand saloon, among many others. Gather and manage resources \u2014 wood, coal, gold, and tools \u2014 to kickstart the local economy and watch your community grow.\n\nBuild a working farm to harvest food for the population and boost trade. It\u2019s also crucial to build the train station: the railroad will ensure a steady flow of tools and materials essential for the town\u2019s expansion.\n\nSo far, so good, right? Far from it\u2026 a real disaster was about to hit. Spoiler: deep in one of the mine\u2019s lower shafts a gas bag ruptured \u2014 a putrid vapor that instantly infected a miner who already smelled worse than a wet dog.\n\nThe town \u201cdoctor\u201d (who was actually the barber, the vet, and the gravedigger) examined him and pronounced, \u201cAside from never having seen soap in years, it was sudden death.\u201d Big mistake. The next day, the walking corpse had vanished.\n\nIt was the \u2018Outlaw Rot\u2019 virus, spread by frantic bites, and in no time the Wild West had become an apocalypse known as Canyon Wasting.\n\nYour mission: rebuild the settlement against all odds and defend it from those infected hordes and zombie bosses, with more bite than a cowboy denied his chaw. Do you dare?\n\nNote: Exciting, right? Survive this farce called \u201cAdventure\u201d and you\u2019ll unlock Arcade mode: a 'perfect run' where you\u2019ll skate through blood puddles, wipe out zombies and super\u2011zombies in one fell swoop\u2026 or you\u2019ll end up moving into your own coffin.",
