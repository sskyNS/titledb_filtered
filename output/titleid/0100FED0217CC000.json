	"description": "This game, released in 1986 in Japan, is an adventure game where players take on the role of Lieutenant Brian=W=Kernighan. Piloting the Armored Fighting Walker, Galleouse, the player must defeat three bio-dolls lurking within the research facility.\n\nThe game progresses with a 3D RPG-like feel. In addition to moving forward, backward, left, right, and rotating left or right, the player can also perform a 180-degree turn, making for realistic, mech-like movements. When encountering enemies, battles are command-based, but with movement incorporated into the command selection, allowing for highly immersive combat. Utilizing movement-based tactics will be key to overcoming challenges in the game. \n\nSince this isn\u2019t an RPG, relying on character growth or brute force to push through isn\u2019t possible, which might be seen as challenging, potentially sparking mixed reactions. However, for users seeking a satisfying sci-fi game, this title is recommended. Additionally, interactions with over 20 unique characters and the distinct world setting are also highlights!\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
