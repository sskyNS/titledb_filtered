	"description": "This title, \"ZANAC EX\", released in 1986 in Japan, is a vertically scrolling sci-fi shooting game.\n\nStory-wise, it serves as a sequel to the MSX version of \"ZANAC\", with players piloting the cutting-edge AFX-6502 \"ZANAC\" to battle against organic intelligence. The AFX-6502 \"ZANAC\" is equipped with both a standard shot and special weapons. By collecting numbered chips that appear during combat, players can switch special shots, and by collecting the same chip consecutively, they can enhance their special shots.\n\nThe variety of special shots includes piercing rounds that take down multiple enemies in a row, omnidirectional shots that fire in eight directions\u2014common in shooting games\u2014as well as defensive barriers, vibrating shots that move rapidly left and right, and rotating shots that spin quickly around the player\u2019s ship. Whether switching between different shots depending on the situation or focusing on strengthening a preferred special shot, players can tailor their playstyle for an optimal experience.\n\nA defining feature of this game is the ALC (Auto Level Control) system. In ZANAC EX, the intensity of enemy attacks dynamically adjusts based on how players progress through battles. Destroying enemy fortresses or shooting down reconnaissance units, for example, weakens enemy assaults. This system ensures that every playthrough unfolds differently, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
