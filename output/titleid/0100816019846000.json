	"description": "Enter the hauntingly beautiful shadow world of In His Time, a 2D puzzle-solving adventure game. There you will meet Olly and join him to solve puzzles throughout each step of his emotional journey of growth and self-discovery.\nI can't see them anymore. But I really wish that I could see and hold them again. Where is my special person? I wonder if I will ever meet them again. \"In His Time\" is a 2D mystery-solving adventure game that faces these feelings.\nThe main character Olly, a young boy who lost his father early, lives with his mother Lyla. His mother has recently become ill, so he is left to attend school and take care of the housework.\nEven at school, Olly is bullied by Bobby the big kid, and his cronies Mila and Hugo. He is also scolded by his teachers every day....... It was as if the world was pushing Ollie into a corner.\nOne day Olly is threatened by Bobby and his friends and together they sneak into a spooky mansion. They steal \"parts\" of a certain work and escape, only to be caught by the owner of the house - an old man named Joseph. Joseph, who claims to be a watchmaker, asks Olly what happened to him and says he won't do anything bad to Olly if he gets the \"parts\" back from Bobby and his friends.\nWill Olly be able to reconcile with Bobby and the others? What will happen to his mother? And who is Joseph? Olly's adventure begins. We hope you will join us to see how it ends and how he develops!",
