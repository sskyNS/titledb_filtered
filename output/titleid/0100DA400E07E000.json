	"description": "Welcome to the world of Radiation City where a great survival adventure awaits you!\n \nForty years after the unfortunate accident of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, destiny brings you to the area of carefully recreated city of Pripyat. Uncover the amazing story, untangle the mystery and try to save your loved one.\n \nThis is not an easy task. It\u2019s a huge open world area filled with dangers and anomalies. Hungry predators and sub-human creatures, they all want a piece of you. The elements, combined with radiation and unexplained phenomenon, make the lovely looking environment a place where you shouldn\u2019t be.  Yet, here you are.\n \nScavenge for resources inside any building and especially the landmarks of Pripyat: hotel Polissya, the cultural center, cinema Prometheus, the swimming pool and all the abandoned flat buildings. Craft and choose your gear wisely. Discover and use the campsites for safely passing the nights.  Equipment, weapons and the vehicles you may find and use are your only friends.\n \nGood luck!",
