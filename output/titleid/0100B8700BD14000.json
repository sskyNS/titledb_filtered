	"description": "The main idea is the same: when you activate each cell in the game field, it changes the colors of the cell and any adjacent cells in a straight line. Each cell switches between three different colors, and your task is to make them all match the same color.\n\nIn 'Energy Cycle Edge', most part of puzzles are three-dimensional, so you'll need to monitor the changes of colors within several linked layers, adding a new facet to the familiar gameplay.\n\nFeatures:\n- 44 levels in 4 different sets\n- IDM/Ambient soundtrack from different artists\n- \u00abRandom colors\u00bb mode that allows you to go through any level multiple times\n- \u00abClassic cells\u00bb mode for fans of the original game",
