	"description": "Featuring a rich single player campaign, wave mode missions and lots of unlockables, Gearbits is a love-letter to the mecha genre!\n\nThe game contains a variety of mechs, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

Enemy pilots and swarms of giant insects stand in your way, as you try to complete the various objectives along the story campaign that spans 30 missions.\n\nOver 30 unique weapons to choose from. Equip a missile launcher, a rail gun or a massive beam cannon. You can build a game breaking winning combo, or set up a specialised loadout for a challenge run.\n\nGearbits for Nintendo Switch\u2122 includes the \"Raider Expedition\" expansion.",
