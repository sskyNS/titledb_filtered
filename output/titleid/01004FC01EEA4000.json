He needs to know: Did Ginka ever come back? Could she be living a normal high school life?\n\nSadly, his faint hopes are crushed when he learns that Ginka was never seen again after that night. He dejectedly prepares to depart, but then he meets a young girl who looks exactly like his missing childhood friend\u2015 Ginka.\n\n\"\"Welcome back, Ryusei.\"\"\n\nThe girl doesn't know her own name. All she knows is that she loves Ryusei.\n\nWhere has she been? Why hasn't she aged?
