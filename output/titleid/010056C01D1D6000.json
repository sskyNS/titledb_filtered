	"description": "You jump into the role of a little bird, exploring beautiful landscapes and collecting magical crystals that mark certain landscapes.\n\nBecause there are no enemies or any other danger in this game you will be able to lean back and enjoy the scenery and the sensation of flying. It is a great game for relaxing and calming down after an exhausting day full of hassle.\n\nOf course, you can always select the level that you feel helps most to relax yourself. Most levels can be finished quite quickly so that you can freely choose to spend time exploring the environment but you don\u2019t have to stay for too long if you are just looking for a short moment of peace and enjoyment.\n\nThis game features a collection of some of the most beautiful sceneries from the Aery franchise.\nWe hope you like them. So lean back and take a deep breath\u2026",
