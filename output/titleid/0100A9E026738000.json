	"description": "Nightfall Village is a pixel-art action adventure where players slash through lurking zombies, explore eerie forests, and fight their way across a shadow-covered countryside. With retro-styled graphics, punchy animations, and a determined village hero, the game delivers quick, satisfying combat perfect for short bursts of action or longer dungeon-crawling sessions. Level up, complete quests, and push back the darkness as you uncover new areas, battle undead swarms, and light your path through the night. Sharpen your blade, follow the glow of the lanterns, and defend the village before the shadows take over!",
