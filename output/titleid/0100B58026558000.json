	"description": "CloverPit: Devil\u2019s Gambit drops you in a grimy cell with nothing but a cursed slot machine, a hungry ATM, and a debt that grows sharper every round. Pay up or drop into the pit \u2014 those are your choices.\n\nEvery spin is a gamble with your life. Rig the machine with strange charms, chain wild combos, and watch your winnings snowball\u2026 or vanish in an instant. The further you push your luck, the crueler the pit becomes.\n\nThis is a rogue-lite about temptation and survival, where greed can save you just as easily as it can ruin you. Twist the odds, outsmart the house, and claw your way toward freedom before the pit swallows you whole.",
