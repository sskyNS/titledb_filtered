	"description": "One player is trapped in a room with a ticking time bomb they must defuse. The other players are the \u201cExperts\u201d who must give the instructions to defuse the bomb by deciphering the information found in the Bomb Defusal Manual. But there\u2019s a catch: the Experts can\u2019t see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out \u2013 fast!\n\nRounds are fast-paced, tense, occasionally silly, and almost always loud.\n\nPuzzle-solving and communication skills \u2013 and maybe a few friendships \u2013 will be put to the test as players race to defuse bombs while communicating quickly, clearly, and effectively.\n\nFeatures\n\u2022 Challenging puzzles \u2013 Test the limits of your communication skills... and friendships?\n\u2022 A different bomb every time \u2013 Procedurally generated puzzles keep the action fresh.\n\u2022 Local co-op party game \u2013 Bomb defusing is a team endeavor. Going solo is not an option!\n\nThe Bomb Defusal Manual is freely available at http://www.bombmanual.com and can be printed or viewed on a tablet or any other web-enabled device.",
