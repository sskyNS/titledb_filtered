	"description": "\nFeatures:\n\n- One hundred different endings.\n        Choose your path, every decision leads to a new ending.\n        Will you find the real one? Is there such a thing?\n        Only one way to know...\n\n- Lots of \"Aha!\" moments.\n        The world doesn't change with each new game, you do.\n        Well, actually it DOES change, but that's a secret for you to find out.\n\n- A big bunch of unlockable stuff.\n        New playable characters, hints, costumes, visual effects and more!\n\n- Bazillions of secrets and pop-culture references.\n        They are, you know, secrets. So we won't spoil them here ;)\n\n- Magic\n        Even a simple-looking-yet-amazing game like this takes a lot of time and big piles of money to make, but you can get it for only a few bucks.\n        How's that for magic?\n\n- Time travel, battle royale fights, mimics, permadeath, shotguns, mining, resource gathering, base building, global leaderboards, farming...\n        Ok, we may have had exaggerated on that one...\n        OR HAVE WE???\n\n- Humor.\n        Yup, there's that too.\n        Available in many flavours.\n\n- A beautiful OST.\n\n\nHere's how to play Reventure in 8 easy steps:\n\nStep 1: Adventure calls... Wake up, hero!\n\nStep 2: Meet your mentor and gear up for glory...\n\nStep 3: Then... Embark on your quest!\n\nStep 4: Ok, don't embark...\n\nStep 5: Face the consequences...\n\nStep 6: Rise again...\n\nStep 7: Fix your past mistakes...\n\nStep 8: And become a legend!\n\nDisclaimer: this is just an orientative guide, you probably won't become a legend on your second attempt.",
