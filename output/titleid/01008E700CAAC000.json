In each such a location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, however, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters. If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything\u2026\n\nWhat can you expect?\n\n\u2022 Official Istanbul game - 100% original rules\n\u2022 Adaptation of TOP 100 board game of all time by BGG ranking\n\u2022 Play with AI, with friends or both\n\u2022 Great artwork by Andreas Resch\n\u2022 Languages: English, German, Dutch, Polish, French, Korean, Japanese, Chinese Simplified, Spanish\n\u2022 Pass and play mode\n\u2022 Cross platform online multiplayer with synchronous and asynchronous modes\n\u2022 Opponents' last moves replay\n\u2022 3 levels of difficulty AIs with individual strategies\n\u2022 Preset or random generated game boards\n\u2022 Atmospheric music and sounds\n\u2022 Unique, original board game experience\n\u2022 Intuitive gameplay\n\u2022 Colorblind mode\n\u2022 Over 70 achievements\n\nWhat are you waiting for?
