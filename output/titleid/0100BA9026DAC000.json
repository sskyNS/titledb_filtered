	"description": "Step into a warm, flour-dusted world where pan dulce takes center stage. Merge adorable conchas, cuernitos, and more to discover delicious new treats in this whimsical puzzle game. With a dash of strategy and a sprinkle of tradition, PancitoMerge blends the joy of classic falling block games with the vibrant spirit of a neighborhood panader\u00eda. \n\nGreat for cozy breaks or chasing a high-score, no baking skills required!\n\nThe goal is simple: merge matching breads to create higher-level ones, aiming for the highest score possible while unlocking every type of bread in a single run. But be careful, the game ends if the breads stack up to the top of the bag!\n\nA Tasty Twist: Every 5 drops, a customer arrives with a specific bread request. Fulfill their order by clicking/tapping on the requested bread in the bag.\n\nPancitoMerge is a love letter to Mexican culture and the joy of pan dulce. From colorful conchas to buttery cuernitos, each bread is inspired by real treats found in local bakeries, celebrating the warmth, tradition, and creativity of Mexican baking. ",
