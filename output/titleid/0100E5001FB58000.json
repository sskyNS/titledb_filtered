	"intro": "Cricket: Jae's Really Peculiar Game is a funny and heartwarming hand animated JRPG from Studio Kumiho.\n\nAfter a devastating loss, Jae would do anything to fix the past. Blast off on that quest with your newfound friends on a journey to the gates of Yimmelia, a fabled land on the moon that\u2019s rumored to grant any wish.\n\nThis JRPG draws on ideas from genre classics, but with varied new gameplay twists. You\u2019ll explore forests, cities, rock concerts and more, with traversal that is always fun and dynamic; there are no random encounters, while you can dash and charge into objects (and people!) for unique results. How you interact with people will influence game events and combat.\n\nCombat incorporates timed hits, with special combinations as you team up with amazing party members. Build the meter, attack and defend, while unleashing awesome combos for better rewards!",
