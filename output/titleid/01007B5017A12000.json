	"description": "Itching for some more good ol' Kung Fu action? \nThe free Arenas expansion adds multiple hours of gameplay that will put your Kung Fu to the test. With 5 new game modes, 15 dynamic locations and 120 challenges, gear up for spectacular combats, brutal opponents, and endless opportunities to refine your moves.\n\nIs one life enough to have Kung Fu?\nWhether you choose to play as a male or a female character, in Sifu, you will ponder that question on your path for revenge, hunting down your family\u2019s assassins. One against all, you have no allies, countless enemies, and a mysterious amulet to bring you back to life every time you die. Yet, be warned! Your secret weapon comes at a hefty price to pay: aging and its consequences. \n\nLearning by fire \nYour enemies don\u2019t wait their turn, and they don\u2019t broadcast their intent. Dodge, parry, strike, use combos and be like water making its way through captivating environments. Learn how to master your art, whether by fighting through the underbelly of a nightclub, scrambling through a refined gallery to avoid getting surrounded, or vertically navigating a towering office building.\n\nAdaptation is survival\nCareful positioning and clever use of the environment to your advantage are key to your survival. Use everything at your disposal: throwable objects, makeshift weapons, windows and ledges... The odds are stacked against you, and you will be offered no mercy.\n\nTraining never ends\nKung Fu is mastery through practice, a path for both the body and the mind. Learn from your errors, unlock unique skills, and find the strength to master the devastating \ntechniques of Pak Mei Kung Fu.\n",
