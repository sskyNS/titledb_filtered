	"description": "Set against the picturesque backdrop of the Eastern Canadian coastline in the 1980s, Moonglow Bay invites you into an emotionally charged story within a tranquil slide-of-life fishing RPG.\n\nStep into the shoes of a rookie angler, compelled by the final wish of your beloved partner, as you navigate the trials of a town on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nWhether braving the waters solo or teaming up with a friend in drop-in-drop-out local co-op, immerse yourself in cooking your daily catch and selling flavourful recipes to upgrade your shop, gear, and fishing boat.\n\nCombining a playful voxel art style with a sumptuous soundtrack by Lena Raine, your journey is split into several distinct story arcs featuring a fully-inhabited town to traverse and the potential for epic encounters with the rumoured Mystical Monsters of Moonglow. \n\nEquipped with nothing but your journal and trusty rod, venture to the ocean's farthest reaches, from icy glaciers to steaming geysers. Master the art of casting nets, setting traps, and fishing through ice as you document the 151 aquatic species and explore the diverse local wildlife all while unearthing the secrets hidden within Moonglow Bay.",
