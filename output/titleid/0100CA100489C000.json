	"description": "Bust out anywhere, with anyone on the Nintendo Switch\u2122. Team up with another inmate for local two player split screen mode, taking a Joy-Con\u2122 each to either team up to break out, or work against one another to determine who\u2019s the quickest convict to make an escape.\n\nRisk it all to breakout from the toughest prisons in the world. Explore the biggest prisons yet, with multiple floors, roofs, vents and underground tunnels. You\u2019ll have to live by the prison rules, attending roll call, doing prison jobs and following strict routines; all the while secretly engineering your bid for freedom! Your prison escape antics will take you from the frosty Fort Tundra, to a train hurtling through the desert, and even to the final frontier!\n\nEscape Team Assemble!\n\nUnite with up to 3 friends to create the ultimate online escape crew and engineer the wildest escapes yet! By working together you\u2019ll be able to create even more elaborate and daring plans. Feeling competitive? Dive into the versus mode and show that you\u2019ve got the skills to break out of any prison faster than your friends can. If all else fails, settle your rivalry in the court yard with a prison punch up!\n\nCreate YOUR Con!\n\nIt\u2019s time to make your prisoner truly yours. Choose from a massive array of customisations to make your character unique to you. It\u2019s important to look stylish whilst you mastermind your escape.\n\nCraft your Escape!\n\nBeing in prison forces you to be creative and work with the limited tools at your disposal. You\u2019ll have to combine everyday objects like soap and socks to craft new weapons and tools to help you achieve your goal. Steal forks from the cafeteria to chip a tunnel in your room, and craft a poster from magazines and duct tape to hide the evidence. You\u2019ll soon learn that duct tape solves (almost) everything!\n\nPrepare for a fight!\n\nThe Escapists 2 introduces a brand new combat system to make every prison brawl more exciting and interactive. You\u2019ll have to block and tie together chains of attacks whilst strafing around your locked on targets to gain the upper hand in combat. Make sure your visit the gym first to build up those muscles!\n\nNew ways to escape!\n\nAs the prisons get tougher you\u2019re going to have to get more creative with your escape plans. There\u2019s a ton of options to tackle almost any prison escape.\n\nFeatures\n\n\u2022 10 Prisons\n\u2022 2 player split-screen play, and up to 4 player co-operative and versus online multiplayer\n\u2022 Drop-in/Drop-out Online/Split screen multiplayer\n\u2022 Over 300 customisations\n\u2022 Multi-storey Prisons",
