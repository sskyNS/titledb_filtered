	"description": "You have no memory of your adventure or heroic strength,\nand yet the people celebrate you as the Hero who saved the\nrealm.\n\nThis is just your typical adventure game filled with heroes and\nheroines...except it starts where games usually end.\n\n\nIn the midst of an unconscious state,\nyou hear a voice desperately calling out to you.\n\n\"\"....ster...ro... Master Hero!\"\"\n\nThat's when you wake up and see...\nthe Demon King cursing you as he vanishes into thin air!\n\n\"\"...Huh?\nIs this for real?! But I'm way too late!\nThe Demon Lord was already defeated when I got here!\"\"\n\nAnd so you become the Hero destined to save the realm.\n\nAt the very moment you deal a deadly blow to the Demon Lord,\nyour memories of your previous life come flowing back.\n\n\nAnd thus, the heroic group decides to return to their homeland.\nEach country you stop in along the way welcomes you with\nopen arms as the Hero who saved the realm.\n\nIt seems like you have it made, but maybe it really is too good\nto be true. \n\nThe real battle is only getting started!\n",
