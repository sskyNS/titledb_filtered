	"description": "Released in Japan by SEIN SOFT in 1986, this side-scrolling action RPG casts players as the hero Triton in an adventure to defeat monsters and restore peace to Luwanda Island, controlled by \"Pay-Valusa.\"\n\nTritorn primarily fights using jumps and sword strikes. By anticipating the enemy's movements, he will swing his sword, and executing a sword strike from a jump inflicts double damage, showcasing an advanced technique. Furthermore, as Tritorn grows, he learns magic, allowing him to halt enemy movements or instantly eliminate them. \n\nWhile the game is an action RPG, it's not just about defeating enemies. There are puzzle-solving elements incorporated, where defeating specific enemies in consecutively rewards players with items. Some puzzles may be challenging, but they add depth to the gameplay.\n\nFeaturing fast-paced action, skill-based combat, engaging puzzles, and three learnable magic spells as Tritorn grows, this game offers a rich experience for action RPG enthusiasts and is also recommended for newcomers.\n\nThe MSX (ROM cartridge) version features added powerful bosses and increased final boss attack patterns. Clearing later stages will likely require different procedures than other platforms.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
