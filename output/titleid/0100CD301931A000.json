Normal, unprocessed food is claimed to be toxic and people are forced to eat only Nutri-Paste: a tasteless homogenic paste made out of all edible ingredients (including tree bark, weeds and stems). Growing or preparing your own food is forbidden and all knowledge of cooking techniques has been lost. Tasteless lives make people apathetic, ambitionless and generally dumb. Technology is at a standstill.\nThe Resistance, led by General Ohm and formed of people who were taste-awoken, fights a losing battle. That is until they construct a device that allows them to re-discover the recipes of the old world\u2026",
