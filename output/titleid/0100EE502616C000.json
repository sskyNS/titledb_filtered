	"description": "Direction Quad is a 2D action-adventure presented in top-down pixel art style. Take the role of young Quad as he hops through the swamp in any diagonal direction, collecting coins and bugs along the way. The objective is to get Quad from his starting lily pad to the finish line of each stage without colliding with the terrain or any treacherous traps.\n\nAs you advance, the mazelike levels get more complex! Use bumpers to ricochet along the best lines, hit switches to open new paths and keep Quad from kicking the bucket! Replay stages as many times as it takes, but beware, there is greater danger lurking in the swamp than even the Wize Toad may realize!\n\n\u2022 Master a gauntlet of unique stages.\n\u2022 Take the role of a young frog and hop in top-down puzzle action.\n\u2022 Avoid traps and enemies as you race for the finish line.\n\u2022 Retry levels as many times as it takes.\n\u2022 Enjoy retro pixel art aesthetics and old-school challenge.",
