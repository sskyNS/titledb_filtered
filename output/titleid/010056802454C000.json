After the final strike of Operation Midnight Hammer bombers rang out, the heat of battle was swallowed by extreme cold in the aftermath of nuclear facility destruction. Strategic strongholds fell under the dominion of frozen snowfields, and the world entered a rapid cooling period, facing a new phase. Deep within the frozen earth, rare minerals that could spark the next generation's energy revolution still slumber, wrapped in ice crystals. These crystalline bodies, glowing as if imbued with life, possess the essential power needed to rebuild the collapsed world.\n\nThe secret research team of the massive corporation 'Kronos Industries' developed new technology capable of mining these minerals even in extreme environments. While appearing to be an IT company on the surface, they harbor ambitions to monopolize unknown energy in the devastated world and establish a new world order. Kronos reorganized the 'Shadow Legion', composed of former special forces personnel, strengthening cold-weather equipment and advancing the development of frozen mines.\n\nTheir movements were detected by international intelligence agencies, and nations dispatched elite special forces to the snow-swept wastelands. They were tasked with preventing Kronos's energy extraction and making secured resources a shared asset of the recovering international community. However, the Shadow Legion also stands ready to fight back with the latest cold-weather equipment and organizational strength. In this extreme battlefield, you will take on the 'Combat Strike' mission as a member of the special forces.",
