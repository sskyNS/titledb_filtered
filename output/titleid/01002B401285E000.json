Asterix and Obelix are back\u2026 And it's going to be another great fight!\n\nPlay as Asterix and Obelix in cooperation (local multiplayer mode) with family or friends!\n\nSlap thousands of Romans away with a wide range of moves and unique combos to each character!\n\nThe Adventure mode chapters are based on existing Asterix & Obelix albums.
