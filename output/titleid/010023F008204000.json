	"description": "Form your party (a group of secret agents) from among four races: Human, Oni, Tengu, and Nekomata. Then conquer the terrifying and mysterious Yokai-filled castle!\n\n\u25a0The Yokai in Hyakki Castle\nThe game reproduces Yokai from ancient Japanese literature, including the giant skeleton Gasha Dokuro and a Yokai made up of a woman's head and arm.\nMany creepy and terrifying monsters will appear.\nThey await your secret agents (players) in Hyakki Castle.\nPowerful bosses will be unleashed at certain points as you make your way up through the castle. Aim for the tower, where the master of the castle awaits!\n\n\u25a0Main Theme: Dan no Ura\nDan no Ura, an original song by the Biwa player Sae Ishida, creates a creepy atmosphere.\n\n\u25a0About Real Time Dungeon RPGs\n\"Real time dungeon RPGs play like an action game, in which you move around and fight on a floor with a grid layout. With the exception of some portions, the game plays out in real time.\n\nWhen in combat, the enemy won't wait for your attack.\n\nBattle by avoiding enemy attacks and timing your own attacks at the right moment.\"\n\n\u25a0A Yokai-Filled Castle with Death Looming Around the Corner\nThe player's secret agents will storm Hyakki Castle, where formidable Yokai and terrifying traps await.\nBe careful. One miss will cost you your life.\nEat the food you find in the castle to survive. An empty stomach will lower your stats.\n\nThere's nowhere to relax in this castle. Eat, sleep, destroy Yokai, and search the castle.\n\nIn the Yokai-filled Hyakki Castle, you're always one step away from death.\n\n\u25a0The 2 Party System\n\"The game has a split party system that uses the Tokugawa treasure item Ishin no Ofuda.\nThe player can freely split up into two parties at any time (the game will go into split screen mode).\nWhen necessary, split into two teams to deal with the traps and challenges in the room.\nIn addition, the party you aren't controlling will use spells to temporarily harden themselves, increasing their stamina.\nAttack enemies from the rear to deal massive damage. Use the hardened party with high stamina as a decoy, and send the other around to the back.\"",
