Built from the ground up for Nintendo Switch\u2122, Dementium: The Ward combines smooth first-person shooter gameplay with a demented tale of mystery and terror.\n\nYou wake up in an abandoned hospital with nothing.

Strange creatures roam the corridors.\n\nDeranged puzzles lead you through a twisted maze of locked doors. You find a flashlight, weapons, pills, and ammunition - all conveniently placed along your path.\n\nWho is orchestrating this nightmare? Will you discover the truth? Will you escape? Will you survive?",
