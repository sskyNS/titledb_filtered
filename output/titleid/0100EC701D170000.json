	"description": "While visiting her sick mother, Claire takes a wrong turn and stumbles into a dark passage of echoing doors and abandoned rooms. Lost, and attempting to find her way back, Claire encounters an over-protective dog and few denizens who are seemingly uninterested in Claire\u2019s plight. Did they block the doors and windows to keep something out, or is a malevolent force stopping Claire from leaving? Why are red candles scattered across the grounds, and why does the sun seemingly never rise? As panic sets in, time slips and begins to fall away. Find the truth, and help guide our protagonist thru the expanded and re-defined Claire: Extended Cut.\n\nFeatures:\n- A blend of modern and retro pixel-art techniques creating a rich 2.5D world.\n- Panic-based horror system that reacts to your decisions and Claire\u2019s panic levels.\n- Multiple difficulty modes, including Nightmare mode where Claire can die from panic.\n- Multiple endings based upon the player\u2019s choices.\n- New enemy available exclusive to Extended Cut.",
