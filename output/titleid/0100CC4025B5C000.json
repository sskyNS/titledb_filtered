	"intro": "The Japanese-style adventure game \u201cCrystal Chaser\u201d has been renewed. A new chapter unfolds in the adventure story of Takanoshin and Noichigo!",
	"description": "This is a refined version of a 1991 adventure game, with this updated version released by GameCorpus in 2023. Players become Takanoshin Shimmen, who must track down the \"Orb of the Sky\" stolen from his childhood friend, Noichigo.\n\nThe game uses a command-based system for intuitive play. Although there's a slight mismatch between the graphics and the tone of the story, it's an enjoyable narrative.\n\nThe original staff expanded the story from 7 chapters to 9 and updated each one. Many new elements have been added, including a completely new chapter, a full remake of the final chapter, new characters, and \"Intermission Theater R,\" which offers mini-episodes of the characters.\n\n\n",
