	"intro": "From the archives of Telltale Games, this jokey poker game pits iconic characters against the Player (that\u2019s you!) in a high-stakes battle of cards, bets, and trash talk.",
	"description": "Recently reopened following a seismic retrofit, the Inventory is once again the hottest gathering place for video game characters to unwind after a long day on the job. Drop in to play No Limit Texas Hold\u2019em with four familiar faces: Max, Strong Bad, Tycho, and The Heavy.\n\nPOKER WITH PERSONALITY: Poker Night combines the strategy of Texas Hold\u2019em with the punchy banter of four famous characters from the Sam & Max, Homestar Runner, Penny Arcade, and Team Fortress franchises.\n\nRETURN OF A CULT CLASSIC: Released in 2010 and removed from sale nine years later, Poker Night was an experimental casual game from the studio renowned for episodic series like Sam & Max and The Walking Dead. This new version has been lovingly remastered by Skunkape Games, a small team of former Telltale employees who worked on the original.",
