	"description": "Potion Craft is an alchemist simulator where you physically interact with your tools and ingredients to brew potions. You're in full control of the whole shop: invent new recipes, attract customers and experiment to your heart's content. Just remember: the whole town is counting on you.\n\nLEARN THE ART OF POTION MAKING\nConcoct your potion plan. Grind ingredients and carefully mix them in your cauldron. Heat the coals. Boil and stir. Add the base: water, oil, or\u2026 something else. Congrats on your first potion! Was it easy to learn? Now try mastering it!\n\nEXPERIMENT AND INVENT NEW RECEPIES\nCarefully plan your route via the Alchemy Map to combine different effects. Be mindful of common sense: you won\u2019t find a market for a poisonous healing potion\u2026 right? Or would you?\n\nSELL POTIONS\nEvery day customers will come to your store looking for solutions to their problems. You will face consequences depending on what you decide to sell them. Attract guilds, befriend notable figures (or feud with them), gain riches and influence - and one day, you may even decide the fate of the whole town.\n\nBUY INGREDIENTS OR GROW YOUR OWN\nEvery alchemist needs ingredients. You can buy them from traveling merchants: it can be pricey, but successful haggling may save you some coin. Or you can just grow your own!\n\nGET CREATIVE WITH CUSTOMIZING\nWant to give a special appearance to your best potions? Go ahead! Change bottle shape, label type, icon, and colors. You can even give it a custom name and label description. Carefully arrange your unique potions to showcase them on your shop\u2019s shelves and tables\u2026 or carelessly throw them around - we\u2019re not gonna tell you what to do, just have fun!",
