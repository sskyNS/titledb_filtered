Upon beginning her investigation, Naomi \u2013 camera in hand \u2013 soon discovers an inexplicable phenomenon in which the townspeople transform into cats and dogs as night falls... Then, as just she\u2019s looking into that particular mystery, a murder occurs... Join her as she attempts to reveal the truth about Rainy Woods.\n\n\u25a0Solve mysteries as a human, a cat, or a dog!\n\nNaomi herself eventually becomes able to transform into a cat or dog.
