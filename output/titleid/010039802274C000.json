	"intro": "A time travel adventure spanning two hundred years. Dive into the past with time agent Fia Quinn as she embarks on seven trips through time.",
	"description": "Fia Quinn is a time traveler, accompanying clients of the ChronoZen Time Travel Agency on jumps to other eras to make sure they don\u2019t rewrite important aspects of history. Some of these people are merely curious. Others have unresolved business. As long as they can pay for the trip, their motivations don\u2019t matter to Fia\u2026 until they do.\n\nJump with Fia into seven time-travel cases spanning two centuries in New York City, from the speakeasies of Prohibition to the vicious gangs of the Gilded Age to the World Trade Center on September 10, 2001. Solve temporal problems, survive paradoxes, and resolve the mistakes of the past or die trying\u2014as many times as it takes. \n\nWhat could go wrong? It\u2019s only time travel, after all.",
