	"intro": "Deep beneath the surface of the dead Earth, \"the City\", the last refuge of humanity, hides. Engineering genius and efforts of all mankind; a giant structure of steel, concrete, and biopolymers.",
	"description": "It doesn't have a name. The locals simply call it \"the City\". Lilies do not bloom here and the sun does not shine. There is no fresh breeze blowing here and you can't hear the birds singing.\nJosiah Kaviani, a young mathematician and statistician, starts his journey in this underground maze of cramped streets. He is talented and intelligent, but he has one terrible drawback \u2013 he is unbearably alone.\nBut soon, Josiah will have a fateful encounter that will turn his whole life and make him break the shell he used to live in. A meeting with someone or, perhaps, something that is hidden in such depths that even the horrific City cannot reach them. Something so secret that the very knowledge of it can be deadly. Something truly monstrous.\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 A well-written world that you\u2019ve never met before.\n\u2022 A dark and frightening science fiction story based on real study.\n\u2022 Complex, adult characters, each with their own motives, aspirations, and skeletons in the closet.\n\u2022 A variety of difficult choices that might lead the story to an unexpected end at any time.\n\u2022 A full range of endings \u2013 from bad to awful.\n\u2022 An atmospheric soundtrack specially written for the game \u2013 it is blood music.\n\u2022 Special art gallery where the player can check their progress.\n\u2022 Some of the author's ideas were censored as to be found too dark and cruel...\n\u2022 ...but most of them remained.",
