In the process, the Z virus leaks out into the world, causing absolute mayhem in the lab...\n\nCan Dr. Zstein and the Zzalgun, mankind's last hope, stop Researcher X and save the world from these mutations?\n\n[ Gameplay ]\n\n- Defend your tower against the evil forces!\nThe monsters created by the head of the lab Researcher X are coming! Players must use their limited resources to create and strategically deploy new units. Construct solid lines of defense and fire your cannons to drive away the invaders one at a time and destroy the enemy's towers.\n\n- Power up your super-simple manufacturing systems\nGain coins by defeating your enemies. Use this gold to strengthen your main force or reinforce your turrets, all to overwhelm your enemies and claim victory.\n\n- Featuring characters from Today's Meme!\nCharacters from the popular emoji pack Today's Meme appear in the game!
