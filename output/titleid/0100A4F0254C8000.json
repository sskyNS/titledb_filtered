	"description": "Our main protagonist is lumberjack Jack from Earth who surprisingly spawns on Mars where he's trying to save its princess.\n\nHand-Crafted levels: Each level is uniquely designed for countless methods of completion. Defeat strange Martian enemies using spontaneous approaches and eliminate them on your way to freedom.\n\nExceptional combat:\u00a0Adapt to chaos with style: stomp enemies like you're squashing grapes at a festival, deliver kicks that would make a martial arts movie jealous, and turn every encounter into a slapstick ballet of traps and tumbles. No bullets, no mercy\u2014just airborne justice and foot-powered fury.\n\nMultiple controllable characters: You will be able to switch between different characters during the gameplay. All controllable characters have different abilities, but of course \u2013 our main hero is the strongest!\n\nUnconventional Storytelling: A mysterious tale unfolds through cinematic sequences \u2014 like a movie that forgot it was a game, took a wrong turn at plot twist junction, and crash-landed into a finale so unexpected it might just file a complaint with reality itself.\n\nAre you ready to help Jack save the Princess of Mars... and maybe the entire planet of Mars?\n\nGame features:\n\n- strange Martian enemies\n- 4\u00a0playable characters\n- 7 engaging large platformer levels\n- up to 4 hours of gameplay\n- unlockable Hard difficulty\n- 42 in game achievements\n- humoristic comments from characters during conversations",
