	"description": "This is a shooting game released by T&E SOFT in 1987. Players take on the role of a Mission Striker, engaging in dogfights against the Gilcen Army.\n\nThe game is a vertical-scrolling shooter where you fight using your main shot and option weapons (a combined attack is possible during two-player co-op). While a shooter, it also features RPG elements like leveling up. Your ship's level increases based on your enemy kill rate after each stage, and reaching a certain level adds new option weapons. Your ship uses a damage system rather than a lives system, allowing for seamless dogfighting.\n\nThe game has 14 stages, each ending with a boss for thrilling battles. Enjoy intense fights against the Gilcen army by mastering dazzling maneuvers, your main shot, option weapons, and combined attacks in two-player mode.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
