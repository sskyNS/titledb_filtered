	"description": "This is an exploration-puzzle game. Bad luck rescuers have only eleven days to get out of the trap on a planet long abandoned by all.\n\nThe ship of a scientific expedition catches a SOS signal, but as a result of an unsuccessful landing, the rescue operation turns out to be a complete failure. You will have to find shelter and adapt to the harsh conditions of the red planet, and even though there are five people in the crew, you have to rely only on yourself.\n\nYou have to explore the abandoned base and defend it, make raids in the desert and collect metal for equipment repair.",
