	"description": "YOUR MISSION: SPOT THE UNSEEN... BEFORE ITS TOO LATE\n\nWelcome to Spectator 2, where your sharp eyes and steely nerves are all that stand between order and chaos. Your job? Monitor live security feeds from the creepiest locations imaginable, detect anomalies, report them, and hope you're fast enough to stop reality from unraveling.\n\nMONITOR THE MADNESS\nWatch real-time security cameras across multiple eerie locations. A flickering light, a misplaced object, a shadow that wasn\u2019t there before\u2014spot and report the anomalies before it\u2019s too late.\n\nA HORROR EXPERIENCE THAT BUILDS OVER TIME \nSubtle at first, but escalating fast, anomalies grow more disturbing the longer you survive. Stay focused, apply countermeasures, and don\u2019t let reality slip away.\n\nMORE PERILOUS ANOMALIES \nThis time, anomalies are more diverse, eerie, and overwhelming than ever. From tiny shifts to full-blown intruders, your perception will be tested like never before.\n\nNO TWO GAMES ARE THE SAME\nThe threats? Random. Your survival? Not guaranteed. Random anomaly generation ensures every round is unpredictable.\n\nEXPLORE HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENTS\nFrom abandoned diners to eerie hotels, every level is crafted to keep you on edge.\n\nEVOLVING STORYLINE \nEvery location holds secrets. New levels unravel hidden connections in the Spectator universe. Every detail matters.\n\nSURVIVAL ISN\u2019T GUARANTEED \nMiss too many anomalies, and reality collapses. Keep things under control\u2026 or face something far worse than game over.\n\nSO... YOU THINK YOU CAN WATCH?\n\nYour only weapon is your attention to detail. Your only ally? A screen full of horrors that may or may not be messing with your mind.\n\nAre you just a Spectator\u2026 or are they watching you back?",
