	"description": "Bursting into the 3rd dimension brings new powers with unprecedented freedom, as a combat system perfected by wrestling is taken to new heights. An ambitious control system supercharges EVERY button, creating a spectrum of abilities that are easy to enjoy yet difficult to master.\n\nCreate your own origin story, as you try to survive in a city dominated by supernatural violence and discover who you really are. Develop powers that make you MORE than human, or lose the spirit that makes you LESS than human - in a vicious cycle that never ends! Find your place among hundreds of other heroes and villains, each trying to rule the world with their own unique powers. Fight over every corner of the map to secure it for your chosen cause, as allegiances change as often as your costume! The city's dozens of locations are filled with hundreds of fully interactive weapons and destructible scenery to add to the action.\n\nUpon discovering every character's secret identity, you can make the world you own by saving your changes in the editor. You can then blow off steam in \"Fight Scenes\" - where you decide WHO fights WHERE and with WHAT! And when it's time to roam back into the city, you'll have the privilege to start each new life fine-tuned to your liking with more and more options unlocking infinite possibilities.",
