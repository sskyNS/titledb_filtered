	"intro": "Relax and listen to the hypnotizing world of Oxytone, slow paced puzzle game where you rotate hexagonal tiles with tangled paths.",
	"description": "Are you ready for a unique adventure like no other? Oxytone invites you to explore the depths of your mind while offering a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life for those seeking relaxation. For more determined players, there are 99 challenges, colorful themes to unlock, and 12 meticulously designed maps. Oxytone is the ultimate puzzle game, equally easy to learn and challenging to master.\n\nStrive for the highest scores by creating the longest paths and achieving impressive combinations. Every move matters, and success depends on strategy and planning. You can discard tiles that don't fit your plan, but this reduces your pool of available tiles. To refresh it, you must fill tiles by guiding paths through them six times, deepening the mechanics further.\n\nSound is an integral part of Oxytone, so I recommend playing with headphones. This will immerse you even deeper into the game. The sound design has been crafted with great care to create a unique and relaxing atmosphere, yet it can also deliver powerful moments when needed.",
