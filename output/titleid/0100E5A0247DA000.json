	"description": "Camp Life: Wilderness Survival 2025 drops you off in the great outdoors and lets you figure it out from there. No hand-holding, no shortcuts\u2014just nature, your gear, and whatever you make of it.\n\nSet up camp, cook over open flames, explore dense forests, and brave unexpected weather. Whether you're hunting for food, gathering supplies, or just trying to keep your fire from going out, survival is in your hands.\n\nCustomize your camper, craft tools, and adapt to changing conditions. Some days are peaceful, others are unpredictable\u2014but every moment feels earned.\n\nForget the Wi-Fi. Learn to pitch a tent.\nAnd if the raccoons steal your food\u2026 well, that\u2019s on you.",
