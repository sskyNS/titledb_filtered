	"description": "The Exit: Liminal Anomaly Horror immerses you in a chilling, endless corridor where reality itself begins to unravel. Trapped in the sterile halls of a mysterious office, you must navigate through spaces that feel increasingly alien. Objects shift, sounds echo in impossible ways, and something unseen follows your every move. The deeper you go, the more unsettling the anomalies become - each one a reminder that the rules of reality no longer apply.\n\nTo survive, you must be vigilant. If you notice an anomaly, turn back immediately; ignoring it could cost you dearly. But if nothing seems off, keep moving forward, always cautious of the subtle distortions creeping into your surroundings. Your only goal is to escape the hall before it swallows you whole, as every step you take might lead you closer to the truth or deeper into madness. The smallest shift in the environment may reveal a hidden secret, slowly uncovering the horrifying truth behind the building. \n\nHowever, missing even the slightest anomaly may leave you trapped forever, lost in a world where reality breaks down. Trust your instincts, because every decision could be your last. Will you find your way out of The Exit, or will you become another lost soul in the endless maze?",
