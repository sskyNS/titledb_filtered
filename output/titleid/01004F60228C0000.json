	"description": "Long ago, three brave heroes, Isabella and Arnold, defeated \u201cCrimson,\u201d the evil force that once ruled this world, bringing peace. Fifty years since that battle, darkness now threatens the world again.\n\nOne day, Nopoli\u2019s elder witnessed a sinister falling star, sensing it as a sign of evil\u2019s return. He summoned a young man possessing a mysterious orb, passed down from his father. Accepting his destiny as the Holy Hero (as legend foretold, five heroes with sacred gems would lead to peace), the young man journeyed to find the remaining four and vanquish the rising darkness.\n\nAt the same time, the four destined heroes each received their own divine revelations and awaited the arrival of the Holy Hero.\n\nThis is a role-playing game released in Japan by XTAL SOFT in 1989. Players become the \u201cHoly Hero,\u201d embarking on an adventure with four companions to defeat a resurrecting evil force. Before the protagonist, players experience prologue chapters for the warrior Gobas, priest Rima, wizard Marlon, and female warrior Natasha. Afterward, the protagonist joins them, forming a party and starting the full adventure.\n\nThe game features a top-down view, with encounter-based, command-selection battles. The story spans over ten chapters. While familiar players may notice hidden references, the game is fully enjoyable even without prior experience.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
