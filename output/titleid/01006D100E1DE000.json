	"description": "Surrounded by threats and paralyzed with fear \u2013 home is hell sometimes. There\u2019s this kid who\u2019s stuck in a really bad place. Can you help him escape the misery of an abusive home? Pick up your Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\u2122 controller and pull him out of this mess \u2013 literally. Swing the controller to crush upcoming threats. Go at it alone or join forces with another player. There are 40 hellishly hard levels to get through. But surely it\u2019s all worth it to save a child in trouble?\n\nWhat to expect in home escape?\n\n-        The pain of sore muscles after the workout\n-        The struggle of 40 insane levels\n-        The hardship of going through it alone\n-        The torment of cooperating with a fellow escaper\n-        The misery our little hero is going through\n-        The satisfaction from saving an innocent child\n-        The fun of sharpening your wits and reflexes",
