	"intro": "The toughest prison sim in the yard is back to serve its 3rd consecutive sentence!",
	"description": "Create your own inmate and see how long you can survive in a sprawling facility, where hundreds of fellow prisoners are trying to get through each day in real-time. Develop relationships with an advanced dialogue system that allows you to start conversations before the drama comes to you. Should you choose violence, a combat system perfected by wrestling lets you express yourself with your fists! Hundreds of fully interactive props can be equipped in either hand as tools or weapons - including mind-blowing gunplay that allows you to shoot at ANY moment. Reinforced by a creative crafting system, you've only ever run out of ammo when you've run out of ideas.\n\nJust when you think you've seen it all, a whole other police role challenges you to tackle crime from the other side of the fence - keeping existing prisoners in order while patrolling the streets for new ones! An extended outside world makes life worth living, with a wider range of vehicles and animals to explore it. All now presented with higher resolution 3D visuals, a smoother frame rate, and a wider variety of camera angles to enjoy cinematic moments.\n\nUpon earning access to the inbuilt editor, you can save your changes to each character to make the world your own. You can then blow off steam in a special \"Fight Scene\" mode - where you select WHO fights WHERE and with WHAT to see who survives! This even extends to multiplayer opportunities, where other controllers can choose any other character on the scene to either help or hinder.",
