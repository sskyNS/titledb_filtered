As the third installment of the trilogy from the creator of Little Kite and Repentant, this game takes you on an emotional journey through the lives of two characters bound by fate.\n\nSet in a post-Soviet city in the early 90s during a severe economic crisis, the story follows Alexander, an ordinary engineer, and Christina, a 12-year-old girl with a troubled past.
