Molecats spend their time digging into nearby caves and gathering delicious \u2018shrooms and shiny relics, occasionally getting lost in the process.\n\nYour goal is to guide Molecats through the underground by taking control of the environment and changing the path they follow. On their way, Molecats will face lots of dangerous traps, spooky monsters and tricky challenges and meet a whole bunch of strange but interesting characters.\nFeatures:\n- Indirect control via level tiles.. Rotate tiles to connect paths; apply special powers to tiles to make Molecats run, stop, or walk in opposite direction.\n- Simple but challenging. Simple game mechanics at its base with little twists creating more challenging pathfinding puzzles.\n- Peace! Traps and monsters don\u2019t kill, but make your life way more complicated.\n- \u201cNonfailure\u201d gameplay style. You can\u2019t actually lose this game, but if you mess up, you will end up facing even more puzzles.\n- Tons of secrets!
