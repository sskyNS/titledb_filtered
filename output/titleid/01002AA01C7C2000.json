	"description": "Here's another tactical simulation game you never knew you needed.\n\nYou have slimes under your command.\nYup, the weakest of all monsters, slimes.\nNo, they aren't any stronger in this game.\n\nBut what if they have the ability to occupy human bodies?\n\nTake control of strong knights and warlocks to fight your human enemies!\nThere are also demons to take care of, so things can get complicated.\nDemons can't be taken over, but if you use the humans around you\u2026\n\nYou'll find several kinds of slimes, humans and demons in this game.\nThere are over 20 types of slimes to command, each with their own unique abilities. Teleportation, multiplication, there's even a slime that can melt equipment off your enemies!\n\nWhich body will you occupy? How will you fight?\nThe possibilities are endless.\nHumans will try to save their friends whenever a slime tries to occupy them. That could be used as a part of your strategy too.\nUsing items to transform your slimes into different types will help you in the more challenging battles later in the game.\n\nLend your wisdom to the slimes and help them take over the world!",
