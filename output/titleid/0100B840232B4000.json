	"description": "A magical visual novel set deep in the forest\n\nOne day, in a sparkling, hidden corner of the forest, some little dragons found something very special:\na mysterious egg, hidden among the leaves and surrounded by golden sparkles!\n\nIntrigued, excited, and a little nervous, they decided to do something very brave:\nTake care of it and protect it with all their hearts.\nThey knew that inside that egg could be a unique, perhaps even magical, creature!\n\nWhile waiting for it to hatch, they lived an unforgettable adventure, filled with:\n\n\u00b7Fun challenges: like building a warm nest with soft leaves and stray feathers.\n\n\u00b7Laughable moments: when they tried to sing a lullaby to the egg, they sounded just like a frog!\n\n\u00b7Many questions: What if what's born doesn't look like any of them? What if it doesn't love them?\n\nBut the most important thing they learned was this:\n\n\u00b7What unites us is not how we look on the outside, but what we choose to nurture with love.\n\nFinally, one day... the egg broke with a tiny crack!\nAnd out came an adorable creature: a fluffy duckling!\nIt wasn't a dragon like them, but that didn't matter.\nTo them, it was already part of their family.",
