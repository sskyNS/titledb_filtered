	"intro": "Step into the shoes of an elite sniper and begin combat missions - disrupt enemy plans while remaining in the shadows. The army won't do where one perfect shot is needed.",
	"description": "Each mission requires careful planning. You must analyze the terrain, find cover, calculate the trajectory of the shot and choose the best moment to attack. One wrong move and the mission will fail. Consider the distance, wind, gravity and other factors to make the perfect shot. Your sniper rifle is your only ally.\n\nWith each level, the tasks become more difficult. The enemies are smarter, the guards are more vigilant, and the mission conditions are more extreme. Use tactical thinking to remain invisible and complete missions flawlessly. Your strategy is the path to success.\n\nThis is not just a shooter, but a real test of endurance, accuracy and strategic thinking. Can you become the one who is feared even in the shadows? Take a rifle and prove that one sniper can change the course of the war.",
