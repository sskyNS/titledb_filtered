	"description": "Iron Meat is a fast-paced, run-and-gun shooter that immerses players in a world overrun by The Meat--an all-consuming interdimensional biomass. With a mix of classic arcade and console mechanics, players will battle against mutated victims and machines, dodge bullet barrages, and crush bosses in nine levels of gore-ific brutality. As Vadim, fight back against The Meat and stop the terrors spawned from scientist Yuri Markov's experiments on the Moon.\n\nMULTI-PHASE BOSS FIGHTS\nIron Meat pays homage to classic run-and-gun titles from the past, with intense boss fights fixed into multiple phases. With three difficulty settings to choose from, players can put their skills to the test, where a higher difficulty is rewarded with an even more challenging boss battle.\n\nMULTIPLAYER COUCH CO-OP\nWho says you have to take on The Meat invasion alone? With 2-player couch co-op, you can grab a buddy to leave a trail of bloody, Meat-infected corpses together! It's double the firepower, double the carnage, and double the MEAT!\n\nOVER 30 UNLOCKABLE SKINS\nYou don't have to be a soldier to fight against The Meat. Hell, you don't even have to be a HUMAN to do so! With over 30 unlockable skins to choose from, players can customize their character the way they want. Each skin comes with interchangeable parts, allowing for greater customization with mixing and matching. Want a shark head on a robot body with dinosaur feet? DONE. Maybe a half human, half doggo? YOU BET! Or how about a cowboy with a tail and demon wings? Hmm...YEP!",
