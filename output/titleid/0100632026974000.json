	"description": "Light the right path in Lantern Push, a charming puzzle game where you control a red panda pushing paper lanterns onto Magical Ember Seals scattered across the ground. When a lantern reaches a seal, magic happens: it lights up, floats gently, and marks another step toward the perfect solution.\n\nWith 30 handcrafted levels divided between the Bamboo Garden at dawn and the Riverbank during the lantern festival, each challenge invites you to think calmly, test ideas, and reorganize routes until everything clicks into place. There is no rush, no enemies, and no penalties. Making mistakes is part of the process, and Undo and Restart are always at hand so you can experiment without fear.\n\nLantern Push is ideal for players who love relaxing puzzles, cozy visuals, and that delightful \u201cnow it works\u201d feeling. Push, light, adjust, and discover the pleasure of illuminating the perfect path, one lantern at a time.",
