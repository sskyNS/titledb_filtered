	"description": "\"Magical Drop III\" is a puzzle game released in 1997 by Data East. With adjustments and additions to the system from Magical Drop II, this version is much more lively and chain-based than its predecessor. Along with the addition of the Magical Journey mode, there are now more ways to enjoy the action.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\n\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\n\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",
