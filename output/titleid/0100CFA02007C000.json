This is his story.\n\nThis Synaxarion includes:\n1 Story Level: Nicaea - The story is uncovered as you play through the experience.\n1 Mini Dungeon\n1 Story of the life of a Saint (Neophytos the Holy Martyr)\n\nAfter an introduction to the saint and the time period surrounding him, play as a witness to his life in Nicaea, a city of present-day Turkey. Complete Quests, collect items, and follow the Saint's trail to hear his story.\n\nThese stories are short and are not intended to take up much time to play through. Expect to play for 40-60 minutes to complete this experience.\n\nThe Synaxarion is a collection of Saints\u2019 lives, which are celebrated each day of the year. They are a light that leads us to Christ in every generation, a living Gospel. The ministry and very life of Christ is worked out in the lives of the Saints, His faithful servants. They are the glory of the Church, the God-bearers on earth and in heaven. Most of the saints were unknown to the world, but the Grace of God made them known to the whole universe and to all the ages. Amen.",
