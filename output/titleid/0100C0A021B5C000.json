	"description": "\"Wind Story\" is a pixel style simulation RPG game. Upon arriving at Wind Chime Ranch, players can immerse themselves in rural lifestyles, including farming, breeding, and fishing. During the day, they can freely roam the Ranch's flower fields, while at night, they can enjoy drinking and dancing by the lakeside bonfire. Players can attract more visitors to the ranch, gradually building their own accommodations, windmills, power houses, and restaurants. They can cultivate a variety of vegetables, flowers, and fruits, and raise diverse animals. Furthermore, they can install various amusement facilities on the ranch to earn more money and create their own recreational oasis.\n\nThe game offers extensive freedom; players can cultivate different crops, care for adorable animals, gather mushrooms and various flowers, fish, and mine. They can collect materials, prepare delectable meals, and interact with characters throughout the ranch. To draw more visitors to the ranch, players can progressively construct windmills, power houses, ranch accommodations, restaurants, hospitals, and amusement parks. These facilities, along with the diverse attractions within, transform the ranch into a resort paradise.\n\nYou can also freely explore the world, capture or cultivate your pets, and let them participate in the construction of the ranch. You can also bring your pets to fight against monsters outside and maintain the safety of the ranch. Build the ranch into a world you love.",
