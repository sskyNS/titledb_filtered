	"description": "A fighting game where you can control your reach!?\nDuring a match, you can extend the reach of your weapon in exchange for your own stamina!\nExtending your reach makes you more likely to be defeated, but it allows you to instantly overcome situations where you are at a disadvantage in distance!\nYou can also shorten your extended reach, so use it appropriately depending on the situation!\n\"Should I extend my reach, even though it makes me more likely to die?\"\n\"Should I conserve my stamina, even though I am at a disadvantage in distance?\"\nThe fun is in being caught between two choices that both seem likely to lead to victory!\nThe thrill of making a decision after much deliberation that leads directly to victory is exceptional!\nAdjust your reach flexibly according to your opponent's actions and seize a new kind of victory!",
