	"intro": "Live the life of a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer and help protect the peace in Lumiose City!",
	"description": "Lumiose City\u2014a home for people and Pok\u00e9mon alike. Thanks to an urban redevelopment plan driven by Quasartico Inc., the lush greenery of verdant parks intermingles with facilities using the latest cutting-edge technology. A lot has changed here since the days of the Pok\u00e9mon\u2122 X and Pok\u00e9mon Y games!\n\nChoose Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile as your first partner Pok\u00e9mon, and then set off on a grand adventure! Your journey will take you to all manner of sights in the streets arrayed around Prism Tower, including shops, restaurants, and places called wild zones\u2014where Pok\u00e9mon roam free. As you catch, train, and battle Pok\u00e9mon, there will be plenty of people to meet too\u2014like AZ, the enigmatic owner of Hotel Z , and Team MZ, the crew that aims to keep Lumiose a peaceful place.\n\nCatch, battle, and Mega Evolve\u2014all in real time!\n\nStep onto the battlefield and command your Pok\u00e9mon directly\u2014there are no turns! For the first time in the Pok\u00e9mon RPG series, Trainers and their Pok\u00e9mon can both move around in real-time battles, and your Pok\u00e9mon will unleash their moves when you tell them to. Strategically swapping out your Pok\u00e9mon and accounting for each move\u2019s timing and area of effect will greatly help you in this new style of battle.\n\nHarness the power of Mega Evolution! Unleash your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s hidden energy to temporarily transform its appearance, enhance its capabilities, and perhaps even change its type. Use this power wisely and try to overcome your toughest challenges, like those posed by the rampaging Rogue Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon across Lumiose City. Investigate these dangerous incidents so you can put a stop to them\u2014you may even encounter new Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon along the way!\n\nCompete in the Z-A Royale when night falls\u2014or battle with other players in the Z-A Battle Club\n\nYou\u2019re invited to join the Z-A Royale, a competition for Pok\u00e9mon Trainers to test their skills and determine who\u2019s strongest. Each night, a battle zone for the competition will appear. Prepare yourself by spending the day catching and training Pok\u00e9mon, then venture into the battle zone to take on other Trainers. Be strategic and complete bonus card challenges as you battle to speed up your climb from Rank Z to Rank A. Reach the top, and you might just have a wish granted.\n\nYou can also test your skills against friends or Trainers around the world in the Z-A Battle Club. Take on up to three other Trainers at once, locally* or online**, in frenetic real-time battles!",
