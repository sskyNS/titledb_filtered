	"description": "The game lets you hop straight into the driver\u2019s seat, but advanced features let players customize their racing experience even further. Your winnings let you purchase new cars of individual driving quality and upgrade schemes, from a pixelated F500 to your very own 16-bit Lancer Evolution. As the game progresses, find out which car suits the different disciplines and yourself best. Some features to look forward to are:\n\nRally Cross:\nClassic race against up to 7 other drivers\n\nRally:\nReach checkpoints on a procedurally generated outdoor track\n\nLand Rush:\nBe in front of the pack when the time ends\n\nTakedown:\nDestroy the other cars\n\nHunt:\nChase the target down\n\nDrift Show:\nScore points by drifting\n\nThirteen Unique Racetracks:\nFrom desert dunes to the city streets. A host of unique pixel environments set the stage for some truly super pixel racing.\n\nHone your drifting, score some Nitro:\nThe more you drift, the quicker your nitro gauge fills up. Use it for an instant hit of speed; equally useful for dodging obstacles or slamming into opponents.\n\nVehicle Damage & Explosion Mechanics:\nIn-race collisions result in visible damage to your pixel racer. Once a car takes too many hits, it goes up in flames!",
