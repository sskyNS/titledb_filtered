	"description": "You're a prisoner in a cell. You have to escape. But is that really the goal? Centum appears to be a point-and-click adventure, but beneath the surface is something altogether different.\n\nUnreliable Narrator: Centum challenges traditional gaming conventions by weaving an intricate narrative where reality is as fluid as the mind of its narrator.\n\nMind-bending Gameplay: Navigate a series of daunting scenarios, each shrouded in uncertainty and enigma. Every click and decision is remembered, forcing you to grapple with the unreliable nature of the narrator's hints and guidance.\n\nShape the Story: There is no singular protagonist in Centum; instead, players shape the behavior of an artificial intelligence through their choices, guiding it towards different outcomes and experiences.\n\nDynamic Dialogue System: Engage in conversations that influence the characters' ego states and alter the course of the narrative.\n\nQuestion Reality: Centum speaks of themes that challenge players to question not only the game's reality but also their own perceptions and beliefs",
