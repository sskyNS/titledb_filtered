	"description": "You are trapped in a small house, suffering from psychosis with no memory.\nCarefully observe your surroundings to distinguish reality from hallucinations, and overcome your illness by taking medication from visitors at the right time.\n\nGAME OVERVIEW :\nIf the hallucinations don't persist, you're safe. Open the door and get the medication from the visitor.\nIf the hallucinations remain, take the medicine by the door.\nFollow this routine for 8 days, and your condition may begin to improve.\n\nGAME INTRODUCTION :\nI am a psychiatric patient.\nI don't remember when it started\u2014or even the moment the headaches began.\nHallucinations are nothing new to me. But when they linger and begin to overtake reality, it's a whole different story.\nI have to take the medication.\nCaught between hallucination and reality\u2014 Are you ready to face the truth?\n\nMULTIPLE ENDINGS :\nThe story doesn't end with just one playthrough.\nReplay the game to find hidden doll pieces.\nEach piece is a key that brings you closer to the truth.\nThere are three main endings.\u00a0\nAnd when all pieces are collected, the true final ending is unlocked.",
