	"description": "What if you woke up one day, and you were a Pok\u00e9mon? You can meet and recruit over 400 Pok\u00e9mon in a dungeon-crawling adventure within their world! Build a rescue team to take on mysterious, changing dungeons and strategically plan your moves as you venture forth to make the Pok\u00e9mon world a safer place\u2026and uncover your true purpose along the way.\n\nAs you recruit Pok\u00e9mon, these trusty teammates will need somewhere to stay, so build rescue team camps to house, manage, and strengthen your Pok\u00e9mon friends. Think hard about who is right for the job and how to approach each mysterious dungeon as you prepare a rescue team. You\u2019ll move a single square at a time or use Auto mode to speed up movement until you engage other Pok\u00e9mon in turn-based battles\u2014but don\u2019t forget about Pok\u00e9mon strengths, weaknesses and potential rare qualities! Even the most capable rescue teams need help sometimes, so if you find yourself in trouble you can send a rescue request to other players online*, or use an offline password system. This version adds Mega Evolved Pok\u00e9mon, gorgeous watercolor-inspired graphics, and more! Get comfortable in being a Pok\u00e9mon, there\u2019s a lot of work to do.",
