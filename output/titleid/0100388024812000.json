	"description": "Money Wash Tycoon puts you in the business of cleaning money\u2014literally. You\u2019re the go-to expert when shady cash needs a fresh start. No guns, no car chases\u2014just rubber gloves, industrial dryers, and a lot of questionable banknotes.\n\nPick up dirty deliveries in all forms\u2014bags, boxes, even furniture. Sort through the mess, spot the fakes, scrub off the bloodstains (yes, really), and get the bills back to your clients looking spotless. Or, you know, keep a little extra for yourself. No one\u2019s watching.\n\nUpgrade your gear, unlock faster tools, and expand your underground operation. Between jobs, decorate your hideout, explore strange secrets, or throw some bills into the furnace just because you can.\n\nIt\u2019s not glamorous, but it pays.\nAnd at the end of the day, nothing smells quite as sweet as freshly laundered money.",
