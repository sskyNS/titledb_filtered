	"description": "Rampage Knights is a cooperative beat 'em up game mixed up with randomized dungeon crawling and exploration which you can play alone or with a friend.\n\nYou play as a hero trapped by a spell in a magical forest. All paths lead you to a nearby ruined castle, infested with goblins, skeletons and other foul creatures. Gear up with awesome and ridiculous weapons and spells and descend into the deep labyrinth below the ruin to face its sinister master!\n\nTry to get as far as possible in a dungeon with randomized items, spells, traps and encounters. Your hero is upgraded along the way (both visually and gameplay-wise) as you find better weapons, items, magic powers and fight harder and harder monsters.\n\nThe main features:\n- Frenetic action inspired by Golden Axe and Binding of Isaac\n- Singleplayer campaign or local co-op for two players\n- Randomly generated environments with rogue-like elements\n- Hero visually evolving with new abilities\n- Dozens of spells and weapons with game changing properties\n- Long term progress with new classes and features to unlock\n- Mighty foot included!\n\nSo what do you say? Are you ready to start the rampage?",
