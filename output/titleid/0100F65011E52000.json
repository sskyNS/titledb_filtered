	"intro": "Mittelborg: City of Mages is a strategic adventure with elements of rogue-like and resource management. ",
	"description": "Mittelborg is the heart of this world and thousands of swords are aimed at it. Monsters, nomads, mercenaries, living deads and rebellious spirits \u2014 Chaos does not sleep and besieges the Universe. Collect resources, get ready for tempests, keep guards on the walls and mages at the towers. While lots of blood are spilt, remember what is at stake. It is better to shed a gallon of blood than lose a single leaf from the Tree of Order.\n\nThink and rule!\n\nMittelborg claims for your unfaltering watch, Chancellor! Different events enforce you to make hard decisions all the time. Whom will you sacrifice: a warrior or a mage? Do you execute or pardon? Spend aether on the repairs or upgrades of weapons? Power is a heavy burden. Will you protect the most sacred, or will you drench it in blood...\n\n Fight, die, fight again!\n\nHuman life is worth nothing where waves of Chaos swamp the shores of Order. It is so easy to die here, and no one worries about tomorrow. No one but you! You are the immortal one. Each reborn is new knowledge. You hone the strategy and save all previous experience, and it will help you endure a little bit longer this time.\n\n The world is huge.\n\nYou start a long and dangerous adventure. There will be dozens of worlds and hostile races, hundreds of unique events, thousands of intertwined destinies and stories ... and you have to take all the risks and make the right choices.\n\n Music \u2014 a powerful magic!\n\nSire, your rule is accompanied by 10 original orchestral soundtracks. Together with music, you are bound to succeed!\n",
