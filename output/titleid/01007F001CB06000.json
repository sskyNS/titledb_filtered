	"description": "Take the roll of Lily, a gleeful oblong sprite drawn into a childlike world of black-and-white sketches with splashes of bright color! Lily takes joy in completing the many puzzling challenges of her minimalistic world, but she will soon find that the more puzzles she solves, the more complex her obstacles will become.\n\nLily in Puzzle World is a 2D platformer filled with single-screen challenges, where Lily\u2019s objective is to traverse each stage to reach a door and move on to the next puzzle. If Lily fails, she\u2019ll instantly respawn at the beginning of the level so she can try again, so there\u2019s not too much to worry about. In addition to reaching doors, Lily can also collect special coins, one for each stage placed in rather tricky spots. Can she collect them all?\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Glide left or right and hop across 50 unique puzzle stages!\n\u2022 Change shape to fit through tight spaces and reach switches.\n\u2022 Avoid perilous traps, from spikes to arrows and more!\n\u2022 Respawn and retry stages as many times as it takes.\n\u2022 Collect bonus coins placed in tricky spots in each level!",
