	"intro": "This isn\u2019t playing war \u2014 this is survival.\nPop the case open, pick your weapon, and make it loud. The world won\u2019t save itself \u2014 but you can leave your mark.",
	"description": "Every class isn\u2019t just a loadout \u2014 it\u2019s attitude, identity, and a challenge thrown in the enemy\u2019s face.\nAssault \u2014 first in, last one standing.\nSniper \u2014 a quiet god who turns heartbeats off with a single click.\nTactical \u2014 cuts through silence, breaks plans, owns the moment.\nCQB \u2014 close enough for the enemy to hear your breath\u2026 right before everything goes black.\nAnti-Armor \u2014 the heavy full stop at the end of any argument.\nMobile \u2014 you don\u2019t see him. You just drop.\nBreach \u2014 if the door doesn\u2019t open, that just means it hasn\u2019t realized it\u2019s gone yet.\n\nMaps shift, situations flip, chaos spreads \u2014 but one rule never changes:\nIf you hesitate for a second, you\u2019re already a memory.\n\nVictory belongs to those who don\u2019t wait for orders, don\u2019t wait for the perfect moment, don\u2019t wait for miracles.\nVictory belongs to the one who steps first. And fires.",
