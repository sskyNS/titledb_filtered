	"intro": "A roguelite-city builder hybrid. Build a gnome city above by looting mystical caves below. Complete fast runs, unlock upgrades, and venture deeper.",
	"description": "A quirky combination of roguelite and city builder mixed into one! Sitting atop a vast network of mystical caves is your little gnome village. Send out your team of gnomes on rogue-lite runs to bring back resources so you can expand your tiny kingdom. As you grow your village, you\u2019ll unlock new abilities, uncover new biomes, and take on bizarre creatures and extraordinary vegetation lurking underground.\n\nBuild Your Little Gnome Village\nAbove the caves is where you'll build your thriving little gnome village. Unlock new buildings, upgrades and abilities, establish production chains for valuable resources, and build up a tiny economy to help your team of gnomes venture further on their adventures for riches. \n\nStrategic Rogulite Runs\nEvery level needs you to think and play strategically. Pick from a variety of gnomes to deploy, each with their own specialty. Place them at the start of your turn and send them to work gathering resources and supplies while fighting off foes. At the end of your turn, reposition your entire team, add more gnomes if needed, and gather again!\n\nBut be warned with each turn, the cave becomes more and more unstable and ravenous bats pick at your supplies. So decide when it\u2019s time move on and choose your path down the caves. The deeper you go, the more supplies you\u2019ll need.\n\nA Different Team For Every Expedition\nEvery run lets you adapt, change, and upgrade your team at various points, making each expedition into the caves unique. Modify your team and playstyle to what you need out of the run, mixing it up when a change in tactics is required. Pick and swap from a variety of gnomes to get the job done, assign game-changing upgrades that combine in unexpected ways, and discover hidden special abilities for certain gnomes.\n\nProgress In Every Run\nVenture into the caves knowing each run gets you resources no matter how they end. The deeper you go, the more valuable resources you can gather but no matter the outcome, you won\u2019t return empty-handed. ",
