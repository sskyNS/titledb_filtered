Capture rival territories and extend your military power over the sprawling map of Zipang. Follow the gripping story of Nathan Gries and answer for yourself what is -- and what isn't -- worth fighting for.\n\nInspired by turn-based strategy games of the past, TINY METAL takes the finely honed gameplay of classical Japanese war gaming and brings it into the modern era with great graphics, 15 unique units, and never-before-seen gameplay mechanics. TINY METAL is the Japanese arcade war game you wish you had as a kid.\n\n\u2022 Story\nPlay as Artemisian Lieutenant Nathan Gries as he commands his units to victory against the villainous nation of Zipang.
