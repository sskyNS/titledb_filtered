	"description": "In Goat Out of Hell, you take on the role of a guardian goat responsible for guiding the souls of pets that ended up in the wrong place after death. Your challenge is to push and place these souls on sacred altars to restore order, exploring stages filled with lava, rocks, marble columns, and unexpected traps.\nThe gameplay follows the classic block-pushing puzzle style but with a special twist: besides moving marble blocks and organizing the pets, you must also fill holes to clear paths through dangerous areas of hell. Each move demands strategy and patience, since a single mistake can cost all your progress.\nWith 30 levels spread across two unique settings, the game begins in the fiery Entrance of Hell, full of bubbling lava, and advances to the imposing Temple of Hell, a dark yet refined place with marble columns and flaming pyres.\nRelax, rethink your moves, and challenge your logic in an adventure that blends brain-teasing puzzles, infernal atmosphere, and plenty of charm in every stage.",
