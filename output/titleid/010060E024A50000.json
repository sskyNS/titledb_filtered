	"description": "In Candy Trail, your mission is to guide smiling ice creams along the sweet trails of an enchanted kingdom to the most delicious celebrations of the year! Get ready to solve puzzles on a hexagonal map, where every tile you rotate or swap can mean the difference between a flavor explosion... or a sugar disaster.\nWith charming visuals, heart-melting sounds, and mechanics that are easy to learn but strategic to master, the game evolves quickly. Rotate, swap, and connect the paths so each ice cream reaches the correct party\u2014and with the right flavor!\nAcross 30 levels spanning the Confectionery, Candy, and Cookie Kingdoms, new characters, split-paths, and even tri-path tiles appear to amp up the challenge. And beware: if flavors get mixed wrong, culinary chaos may ensue.\nIf you love creative puzzles, thoughtful planning, and desserts with personality, Candy Trail is the perfect treat to satisfy your hunger for fun\u2014one scoop of logic at a time.",
