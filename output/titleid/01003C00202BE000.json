	"description": "Standing in your way as you attempt to escape the apartment building is none other than \"leftover food.\"\nBy eating leftovers, your stomach level increases, allowing you to consume even larger portions.\nEfficiently raising your stomach level is the key to escape.\n\nCan you escape this harsh apartment building alone?\n\n[Game Features]\nA ghost story rooted in Japanese culture:\nWith the theme of MOTTAINAI (a sense of regret over waste), this game reimagines Japanese folklore as modern horror.\nExperience the fear that lurks just beyond daily life.\n\nExploration-based horror:\nInvestigate each room of the apartment, uncovering hidden items and notes that bring you closer to the truth.\n\nGame Over if caught by the MOTTAINAI GHOST:\nThe MOTTAINAI GHOST roams the building.\nYour actions will determine your fate.\n\nFor those who are sensitive to horror:\nWhile it includes some light jump scares, there is no grotesque imagery or violent content.\n\nStill, it delivers a gloomy and unsettling atmosphere true to the horror genre.\n\nRecommended as a \u201cbeginner-friendly horror\u201d for those curious but easily frightened, and safe for children\u2014designed for solo play.",
