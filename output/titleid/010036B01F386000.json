	"description": "Hoomanz! is a stealth-adventure game packed with coziness and humor, featuring non-combat gameplay & family-friendly content. Play as Shoo, the mythical guardian of Planet Erf with a hidden dual nature, to scare away all the ignorant invading Hoomanz. Darkness is nature\u2019s friend, light is its enemy.\n\n\nDUALITY OF DARK VS LIGHT\nOn planet Erf, darkness is nature\u2019s friend and light is its enemy. As Shoo you must navigate through the dark, otherwise you\u2019ll get chased and squished with a hug!\n\nDark Shoo: Fierce, fast, scary and fully prepared to deal with the Hoomanz.\n\nLight Shoo: Slow, vulnerable, cute and extremely huggable\u2026 and Shoo hates hugs.\n\nDon\u2019t let them catch you!\n\n\nSCARE THEM ALL AWAY!\nWhen you scare a Hooman, they\u2019ll get yeeted off the planet \u2013 you\u2019re just that scary (or they\u2019re just that fragile). But it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds \u2013 You must stress the Hooman first. You do that using the environment and its tools.\n\n\nYOUR ARSENAL OF STRESS\nLure them with a cute purrr, throw bottles, snap twigs, sabotage lights, frozen yeti jumpscares, dance around dangerous traps\u2026 Shoo\u2019s toolkit is full of mischief. There\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d way to scare off a Hooman, so get inventive!\n\n\nSWIFT MOVEMENT\nDash to get out of a sticky situation, or to simply explore the whimsical atmosphere of planet Erf\u2019s nature. Champion through dash obstacle courses to save creatures and more.\n\n\nNATURE, ICE AND FIRE\nAs you progress through the story, your environment will get more harsh, puzzles harder and the need to save planet Erf even more dire!\n\n\nLAUGH OUT LOUD\nThe game is packed with humour. From idle Hoomanz playing the banjo (if you can call it that), slipping on ice and generally making weird sounds, to cute underpants, their panicked waddling, hilarious screams (recorded by us Koffeecuppers) and much much more!\n\n\nFeatures\n- No combat cuteness\n- Family-friendly\n- Perfect for Casual Gamers\n- Pick-up-and-play style\n- Built for all skill levels\n- No punishing checkpoints or game-overs\n- A Universe of Charm and Whimsy\n- Variety of Situations\n- Built in Unreal Engine 5\n- Laugh-out-loud moments\n\nDisclaimer: Might induce slight cuteness aggression.\n\nAre You Able To Save Planet Erf?!\n",
