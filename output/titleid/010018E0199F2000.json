Wads of money are flying in the sky.\nAim for 1,000,000,000 points!\n\nEven if you happen to be destroyed by the enemy, you will just go back to the beginning of the stage.\nYour score will also be restored to what it was before the stage started, without penalty.\nIt is a kind design that allows you to try again and again.\n\n2-player cooperative play is also supported.\nYou can also enjoy it with your friends and family!\n\nThis is a fun game.\n\nChallenge\nFind and collect hidden panels!\nSecret messages! Can you get to the truth?\nThe higher the score, the shorter the clear time... Challenge the developer's record!\n\nMecha Operation\nGunzohg's basic weapon is a shot that can be fired in any direction.\nThe shot becomes a powerful grenade by the energy that accumulates over time.\nEnergy is also used for dashing and boosting in the air.\nThe use of energy is an important point.\nGunzohg is equipped with a super mode that allows the energy to be unlimited.\nThis means that Gunzohg in Super Mode is the most powerful!\n\nAnd its fighting attack, which blasts away enemies and containers, is exhilarating!\nHowever, if you run out of life, your Gunzohg will break.\nDon't forget to protect yourself with a shield.\n\nThe \"Pixel Game Maker Series\" is a series of games created using the action game creation software \"Pixel Game Maker MV\" that can be enjoyed on the Nintendo Switch\u2122.",
