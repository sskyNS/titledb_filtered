When an intriguing letter summons her to the small village of Bewlay, tucked away in the remote countryside, she sets off by train with her assistant a day behind.\n\nUpon her arrival, however, the mysterious man who summoned her is nowhere to be found. Her assistant never arrives. A stubborn landowner refuses access to the barrow, and the locals are wary of this woman who is traveling alone and (gasp!) wears trousers.\n\nThe excavation of Hob\u2019s Barrow is off to a rocky start. And then Thomasina starts having strange dreams\u2026\n\n\nFeatures:\n-A dark, complex and evolving storyline featuring interwoven elements from real English folklore.\n-Traditional point and click adventure game puzzles and interactions, with an easy modern interface.\n-A cast of intriguing characters, from suspicious villagers to sickly vicars to lordly landowners, all with their own unique stories and motives.\n-A distinct folk horror tone and grounding.\n-Evocative pixel-art graphics, featuring cut-scenes and engaging animations.\n-A suitably atmospheric original soundtrack from The Machine. The Demon. - one half of the duo behind the award-winning \"Football Game\" soundtrack.\n-Fiends in the furrows, the smell of damp soil, and a cat or two.",
