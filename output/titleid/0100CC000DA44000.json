Also present is an ominous red button with the simple instruction to not touch anything! \n\nPush the red button once or press it many times. Your choices and actions will lead to outrageous consequences and 25 unique puzzle endings.   \n\nScavenge for clues, tools, and buttons to solve riddles and trigger explosive events. This deceptively simple console has many mind-blowing surprises for you.\n\nGo ahead, press the button. You know you want to.",
