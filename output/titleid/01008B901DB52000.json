	"description": "Begin your career as a professional golfer. Participate in training sessions, hone your skills, and show your talent to qualify for tournaments that will let you achieve success.\n\n\nREAL GOLF MECHANICS\nType of golf club, angle, speed and direction of wind or even surface. Those are just a few of the important factors to consider when approaching a shot. In addition, you'll need to closely examine the layout of the golf course. Remember that it will be challenging to hit the ball from a bunker full of sand, and when the ball lands in the water, you'll have to play it from the last known position.\n\n\nVARIED LOCATIONS\nVisit Pristine Pines, Dusty Dunes, Grand Grove, and Serene Sky. Each of these maps features unique obstacles such as scorpions, and gusty winds that will try to stop or destroy your golf ball. To progress through the maps, you'll need to win a tournament on each, placing in the top 3 of the leaderboard.\n\n\nBUY NEW TECH!\nDuring your journey, you'll have the option to purchase additional equipment with coins. Acquiring these technologies will allow you to move the ball in unconventional ways, giving you a slight advantage over opponents or more fun. After earning a sufficient amount of experience points, you will receive skill points that you can spend to enhance categories such as Accuracy or Control.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Advanced Mechanics\n- 4 colorful locations\n- Golf tech and skill points\n- Tournaments, training and free play",
