Now, it's the early 90s. CJ\u2019s got to go home - his mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart, and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster. On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of cops frame him for homicide, forcing CJ on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets in the next iteration of the series that changed everything. \n\nDeveloped by Rockstar Games, adapted by Grove Street Games.",
