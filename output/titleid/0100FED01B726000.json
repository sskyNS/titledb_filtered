	"description": "Deep within the bowels of a shadowy research facility, Anita, a girl birthed from experimental procedures, is implanted with the sentient nanomechanical entity known as \u2018Apostle\u2019. Working together with her nanite allies Anita must defeat a series of dangerous prototype bio-weapons as she searches for a way to break free from her nightmarish prison.\n\n- Battle against merciless adversaries: Face axe-wielding mechs, fire-spewing behemoths, and psychokinetic terrors, in vicious encounters culminating in the brutal execution of your foes.\n\n- Evolving Multi-Stage Battles: When threatened, the destructive bio-weapons feature a failsafe causing them to become more ferocious, and often warping environments to enhance their onslaught.\n\n- More than a Weapon: The symbiotic relationship between Anita and Apostle grants her numerous abilities such as Dodge, Parry, a series of Slashing Attacks, and a deadly Projectile.\n\n- Master the Destruction Point system: Utilise Apostle\u2019s nanites to identify structural weaknesses known as \u2018Destruction Points\u2019, and exploit your opponent\u2019s vulnerabilities to land devastating blows. \n\n- Experiment with skills: Earn skill points through combat and challenge stages. Whether you favour a tactical or reckless approach, create unique skill combinations that resonate with your style. \n\n- Take on the Challenge System: Earn skill points by completing various tasks from defeating hordes of minions to demonstrating dexterity in the parkour challenges.",
