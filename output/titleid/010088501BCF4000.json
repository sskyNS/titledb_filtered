	"description": "Where most of his customers find meaning in pastimes like worshipping deranged space gods, feeding random crap to a sentient black hole, endlessly digging for The Treasure\u2122 or mentally enslaving donut shop workers, Wilbur lives a more humble life, fixing the galaxy\u2019s ills one broken ship module at a time.\n\nFIX STUFF: Using a range of tools, diagnostic devices, parts and workshop appliances, you\u2019ll be correcting faults in the modules of procedurally generated spaceships. From simple refuel jobs to total overhauls, get ready to frantically fumble, slice, loosen, tighten, grab and drop as you try to complete as many jobs as you can within each daily time limit. With a huge variety of ships and modules, your hands are gonna get real dirty real fast, in some real unusual places.\n\nREAD STUFF: Flaunt your basic literacy by consulting manual pages for guidance on diagnosing and correcting faults in spaceship modules, as well as operating workshop appliances. And if basic literacy isn\u2019t your bag, then at least you\u2019ve got pretty diagrams to gawp at! All your IKEA furniture-assembly training has led to this moment.\n\nUPGRADE STUFF: Using whatever hard-earned pennies Uncle Chop doesn\u2019t take from you, expand your workshop and kit it out with a range of workstations. From industrial devices to esoteric altars, these workstations will allow you to fix bigger and more lucrative ships. \n\nTALK ABOUT STUFF: Interact with a diverse range of oddballs as you engage with both anthology-style storytelling and a multiple-ending, overarching narrative. The lore is (*consults notes*) \u2018deep and rich and good\u2019, with different factions you can choose to ingratiate yourself with \u2013 each with their own inane agendas. \n\nDISCOVER STUFF: Narrative and random events, hidden puzzles and upgrades, secret lore \u2013 we got all that goodness that ensures each day and gameplay run will feel substantially different from the last.\n\nDO ALL THAT STUFF AGAIN, BUT BETTER: Meeting those escalating R.E.N.T payments ain\u2019t gonna be easy, but chin up, champ \u2013 certain station upgrades will persist across gameplay runs, making life a little more tolerable every time around. You\u2019ll also get faster and smarter the more you do the thing, so keep doing the thing!",
