	"description": "Epyx Rogue\nThe original ever-changing dungeon crawler.\n\nIn the 1980s a computer game emerged that changed the world of fantasy gaming forever. Randomly generated rooms meant that each journey into the infamous Dungeons of Doom was unique. The potent combination of random generation with perma-death proved to be intoxicating, and the game was so influential it spawned an entire genre: \"Rogue-likes\".\n\nNow you too can experience the thrill of dungeon crawling for the fabled Amulet of Yendor in this pioneering game. Delve deep into this recreation of the original graphical port of Rogue by strategy game giants Epyx, that replaced the earlier text-based interface with pixel-art for the first time.\n\n\u2022 Battle dozens of unique and powerful enemies.\n\u2022 Gather armor, weapons, food and other items to help you on your quest.\n\u2022 Scour rooms for secret hidden doors and traps.\n\u2022 Discover strange magical spells and potions, which have different wonderous effects every time you play the game.\n\u2022 Survive through 26 randomly generated levels, each more tricky and dangerous than the last, to find the Amulet, then escape... if you can!\n\nThis modern version allows you to play this classic game with many modern features, including:\n\u2022 Display filters, including an 80s-style CRT filter\n\u2022 Play modes - A standard mode that allows for saving games, and an Iron Rogue mode for the original perma-death experience\n\u2022 An intuative and comprehensive control scheme - access common tasks with a single button press, and more complex or less-used functions via on-screen control wheels\n\u2022 A virtual full instruction manual\n\u2022 Choose from several atmospheric soundtracks\n\u2022 Dozens of unlockable achievements\n\u2022 Global Hall-of-Fame leaderboards",
