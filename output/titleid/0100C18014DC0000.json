	"description": "A demon possessed you one year ago. Since that day, you unwillingly tore a trail of bloodshed through New York City. Waking up on a stormy rooftop, you meet your saviors: the Unavowed, an ancient society dedicated to stopping evil. Life as you knew it is over, but by joining them you have a chance to reverse some of the damage you\u2019ve done\u2014and, if you choose wisely, to redeem yourself.\n\nShape your hero: Name the playable character, choose their gender, and pick from three origin stories to customize the protagonist.\n\nChoose your party: Select two out of four companions to join you on missions across the boroughs of New York City. Each member of the Unavowed has a unique personality and skillset, providing different solutions to the obstacles you\u2019ll encounter. \n\nFollow your conscience: Difficult choices await. In Unavowed\u2019s subtly branching storyline, your decisions could come back to help you\u2026 or haunt you.\n\nPlay how you want: Controls refined for Nintendo Switch\u2122 allow you to play comfortably with either the Joy-Con\u2122 controllers or the touch screen.\n\n\u201cUnavowed is much more than it appears: it's a brilliantly written adventure that makes you care deeply about its inhabitants and subverts your expectations.\u201d Gamespot, 9/10\n\n\u201cWith a great cast of characters, Unavowed is a stylish urban supernatural fantasy that is touching, funny, endearing, replayable and above all, fun.\u201d Adventure Gamers, 5 stars\n\n\u201cAn adventure game of the highest calibre, with a story that'll grip you from beginning to end.\u201d GamesMaster UK, 90%\n\n\u201cThis game is definitely a fusion of different themes and cultures you see in fantasy stories of all kinds\u2014we have Jinn, fire mages, elementals, mer folk, dragons, dryads, fae, and ghosts. You\u2019d think squashing this many ingredients into a blender would just result in something confused and muddled, but it works REALLY WELL, I am impressed.\u201d Pushing Up Roses (YouTube)\n",
