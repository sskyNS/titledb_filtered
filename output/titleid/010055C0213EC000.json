	"description": "The characters are brought to life using the E-mote animation system.\nWhen they breathe, wink, or speak, it all looks very realistic.\nAdditionally, the game features Japanese voice acting.\n\nIn a spring of despair, with no hope for the future.  \nEven in such a world, you were smiling...  \n\nThe one who spoke to me as I sat dejectedly in the park was an exchange student from England.  \nGuided by her ever-cheerful and bright demeanor, I gradually began to regain my color.  \nYet, my heart remained difficult to recover...  \n\nWhen the stars have completely lost their light,  \nwill the unfinished melody play once again at the edge of time?",
