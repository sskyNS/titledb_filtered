	"description": "Grab your helmet and pickaxe, because Sokomine just got explosive! Every puzzle is a mix of brains and blasts. Push mining carts stuffed with dynamite straight into meteors, blow them to pieces, and collect the shiny crystals hiding inside.\n\nYou play as a fearless miner on a crystal-collecting mission. Move through grid-based levels, plan your steps carefully, undo mistakes as much as you want, and trigger fiery explosions at just the right moment. To win, you\u2019ll need to clear every meteor and outsmart every obstacle that stands in your way.\n\nThe Sokomine adventure takes you through 30 puzzles spread across three epic locations. Outer Space teaches you the ropes with simpler challenges. Mining Station tests your skills with tricky craters that stop carts in their tracks. And Lunar Lab? That\u2019s where things heat up, introducing furnaces that destroy carts and force you to come up with the perfect plan.",
