I'm here with you...\"\n\"I'm stumped... It's exactly as she said - and there's no way to cut a phantom...\"\n\"Come on. Chin up... Show me your courage...\"\nTheir fateful meeting was also the beginning of a tragic story...\n\nGameplay\nIt's a visual novel in which you don't need to make any choices, so you can enjoy the story like you would when watching a movie or reading a book.
