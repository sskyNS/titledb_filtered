In this franchise, brawl maps have different routes from classic maps. Maps on brawl mode are more complicated, why not using missiles to attack the opponents on the road, or place the mines at the corners.\n\nProperty Investing\nBuy empty land, build houses or chain stores on it, receive rentals from players who pass by. Buy properties as many as possible, and level up the buildings hard for large amount of rentals.

Cash is the key to invest properties and card purchase, deposit could bring a considerable interest from banks monthly. In offline mode, deposit could be used to buy stocks, be smart and earn some extra financial income. \n\nCard\nCards are the original content in this series, and it is the most strategic system in game, also the unique feature different from other monopoly genre games. Players could buy limited cards in shops by cash. There are different kinds of cards, some of them could level up the buildings, some could control others movements and summon gods. In this franchise, we add some new features, hope players would enjoy them. Tip 1: Don\u2019t miss the guy who wears white suit and a masque. Tip 2: A penny saved is a penny eared.\n\nMechanics\nAfter this series develops 20 years or so, we add a brand new feature - mechanics. It is a special tile in the maps, having different effects in different maps, when it\u2019s on, it could probably change the direction of the road, may turn on or off the banks and shops and even mess up the location of mines and bombs.",
