	"intro": "A cozy, first person metal detector adventure game, where you reunite residents of the beautiful Cornish island of Glasden with things they have lost. ",
	"description": "Relax, explore and experience that childlike sense of wonder as you skip around the island. Traverse the island at your own pace, steadily solving the mystery your Grandpa couldn\u2019t.\n\nEach of the residents of Glasden has objects they have lost, and Morgan must search the island with her metal detector to find these lost treasures. Each of these quests asks you to engage and really think about the potential location of the lost item. On returning, each of these characters rewards Morgan with a unique cassette tape which you can listen to whilst you\u2019re exploring. This music and the detailed audio soundscape throughout Glasden helps to place you in this magical environment. Lose yourself in the quests and lovely audio. \n\nAs you explore the island using your trusty metal detector, you will find many types of items hidden underground. You can take these items to Cenna\u2019s shop, exchange them for credits and purchase new sticker packs and film for your instant camera. You can then decorate the journal with these stickers and the photos you\u2019ve taken. Express yourself in the in-game journal.\n\nThe game features a brilliant original score and fantastic voice acting, featuring BAFTA nominated Charlotte McBurney as the titular Morgan, who voices Amicia in the A Plague Tale series of games. \n\nFeatures\n- Search the island for buried treasure with your metal detector\n- Things are going missing on the island!
