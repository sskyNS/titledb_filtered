	"description": "Jump, Mouse, Jump! is a fast-paced vertical platformer where your only goal is to climb as high as you possibly can! \n\nPlay as a fearless little mouse, hop between platforms, snag tasty cheese along the way, and dodge hungry cats determined to stop your ascent.\n\nSimple to learn but tough to master - every jump counts, every platform matters, and one wrong move can send you all the way down. The higher you climb, the bigger your score and the greater the thrill!\n\nThink you\u2019ve got the reflexes to reach new heights?",
