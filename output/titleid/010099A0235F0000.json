	"description": "-Rekindle a Passion\nTraveler's Refrain is a dark song-casting, story-driven action RPG about one man's quest to find his long-lost love and rekindle his passion. Armed with a magical bouzouki, Traveler will face horrific abominations, challenging puzzles, and unravel the mysteries of a dark forest forbidden to all, as an ancient conflict reaches a fever pitch. It is up to the player to defy the Mecha-Goddesses of Fate and find the machine that will reunite Traveler with his long-lost love.\u00a0\n\n-Master the Art of Song-Casting\nTraveler's magical instrument is capable of casting devastating song-spells as he battles enemies in a gorgeous, smooth combat system. Mix song-spells with elemental melee weapons to produce devastating combos. Show your mastery of music-combat, delivering perfectly timed song-spells and elevate combat to a completely different level.\n\n-Explore a Forbidden Ancient Forest\nA domain full of mysteries and secrets awaits! Dangers and opportunities lurk among the trees and ruins that fill the ancient woods. Traveler will meet other adventurers, pursuing their own goals, be they human or robot. He will also encounter ancient mysteries that only his mastery of song-spells can solve, by altering environments and manipulating objects.\n\n-Customize the Soundtrack\nYour choices will define how the music evolves, creating a unique soundtrack as you adventure through the forest. The Totems, spells, abilities, and more will allow you to customize the playstyle and face the complex dungeons and multi-phase boss battles on your own terms, defying the Fates - and perhaps defining the future of this dark world...\n\n-Experience Hand-Crafted Artistry \nEvery aspect of the game has been created to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience, from the painted art style to each layer of music. Traveler\u2019s voice is provided by multi-genre artist Essenger, with additional voiceover provided by talented metal artists, representing the broad variety and sheer talent of the genre.",
