	"description": "A wise man once said, \u2018You can\u2019t jump on a bike on Mars\u2026 It\u2019s impossible!\u2019\nAnd the other one, less wise, replied, \u2018Hold my apple juice!\u2019\n \nIn other words: if you can\u2019t imagine something, our game is right here at your service.\nPerform the most unimaginable stunts on motorcycles, bicycles, even skis! There\u2019s no backbone to be broken here! And we know a guy who knows a guy, whose sister-in-law bent some laws of physics for us. That\u2019s right, you can get really crazy with our game. So buckle up, or not... It doesn\u2019t matter. The only thing that matters is pure fun and madness!! YEE-HAW!",
