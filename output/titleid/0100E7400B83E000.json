	"description": "Didn\u2019t fancy seven years at medical school? Skip straight to the operating table with the critically-acclaimed Surgeon Simulator CPR, fully revived and feeling better-than-ever on the Nintendo Switch\u2122! \n\nNow featuring all-new motion control functionality as well as local co-op play, it\u2019s time to scrub up for the most immersive version yet of the infamous operation sim! \n\n\nON CALL 24/7!\n\nStep into the shoes of Nigel Burke - a would-be surgeon with a less-than-conventional toolkit - as he performs terrifying \ntransplants in theatre, high-pressure procedures in an ambulance, and anti-gravitational operations in space! Yes, operating on the go\u2019s never been easier thanks to the Nintendo Switch!\n\n\nMOTION (CONTROL) SICKNESS...\n\nFully compatible with the Joy-Con\u2122 controller, it\u2019s \ntime to take Bob the patient\u2019s life into your own hands like never before! Play on the TV, in handheld mode, or using motion control functionality to perform life-saving operations with nail-biting precision. \n\n\nNEED SOMEBODY TO PLAY WITH?\n\nGot a bone to pick with your friends? With split Joy-Con\u2122 support, tag a second surgeon in at any time, whether it\u2019s at home or on the go, to immediately launch local co-op play!\n\n\nFEEL IT IN YOUR BONES!\n\nFrom hammers to hatchets, buzzsaws to laser pens, no \noperation\u2019s ever the same, and thanks to built-in HD Rumble, \nyou\u2019ll truly experience every crunch, crack, splatter and splutter!\n\n\nContaining all the original heart-in-your-mouth (or wherever else you decide to put it!) operations, including the additional teeth and eye transplants from the A&E Edition, Surgeon Simulator CPR also includes the highly-classified Alien Autopsy mode, too! So what\u2019re you waiting for, doc? A man\u2019s life\u2019s on the line!\n\n\nA SECOND OPINION...\n\n\u201cMakes medical malpractice an absolute delight.\u201d - GAMESPOT\n\n\u201cIt's a darkly entertaining way to cut, explore, and appreciate the incredible skill of real surgeons.\u201d - IGN\n\n\u201cFew games take that odd, occasional gulf between what you \nintend to happen and what actually occurs on screen and fill it with such comedy.\u201d - EDGE\n\n\u201cI ended up hooked, playing it for hours, and I'm almost certainly not done.\u201d - TELEGRAPH\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of amazing.\u201d - ROCK PAPER SHOTGUN",
