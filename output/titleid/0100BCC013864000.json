	"description": "Get to the top level and escape the flood. Collect extra points and pocket millions in the bonus zones. You can't play this with a standard ball, this one has special skills - get it up to the maximum speed and score bonuses. Discover new higher levels and when the flood catches up with you and you're in the water use the jet jump and rise above the water table. Remember, immersion in the water raises the electrical voltage of the ball, so lower it down to 0% at special ports. Are you falling down and see that the water is close? Use the rescue bubble and give yourself a chance, keep playing, break records. Are you ready for this challenge? The flood is coming near!",
