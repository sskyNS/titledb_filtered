	"description": "Do you like adventure? Are you a sucker for a world of monsters and magic?\n\nDo you like wholesale violence peppered with coarse language, and served with a side of pixelated booty?\n\nThen buckle up, you legend. We're going for a ride...\n\nGet ready to travel far and wide, taking on creatures of all shapes and sizes in classic turn-based fashion, while discovering the secrets and adventures that Allegoria has in store.\n\nHarvest the body parts of your adversaries for financial gain and personal satisfaction, level up to strike down even greater foes, and arm yourself with more weapons and equipment than any sane person could be reasonably expected to carry on their person at any given time.\n\nThere are more than 144 unique enemies to face on your adventures through Allegoria, from ferocious Canadian geese and majestic tortoises to your bog-standard fantasy staples like dragons, unicorns, and the ever-ubiquitous slimes! There are plenty of beasts and beyond to encounter, each with unique item drops that can be sold in shops for the gold you'll need to purchase weapons and equipment to aid you on your journey.\n\nHave you ever played a game that has one weapon you just can't put down, or an armor set that makes you indestructible? It's a great feeling, isn't it?\n\nToo bad that's not the case here.\n\nIn Allegoria, if you want to get stronger, you'll need to master as much equipment as you can if you want to increase your stats, and if you think you need new attacks or magic spells to bring with you into battle, you'd better replace that old gear with something new, and fast. With more than 80 skills to learn and almost 150 pieces of equipment to collect, you'll want to try them all to find the right move set for you!\n\nThere's no shortage of personality in Allegoria, and everyone seems to have something to say. Most of it's just fluff to fill in empty spaces and make the world seem more lifelike, but every once in a while, someone actually has something useful to say.\n\nThey may be a little rough around the edges, but the people of Allegoria are always willing to guide you on your journey, and they might even have a quest or two for you to earn gold and other helpful items.\n\nThere's a story in there somewhere... it's just buried under layers of madness and debauchery.\n\nIf you think grinding for experience and mastering weapons is tedious, try to unravel this Gordian knot of a narrative.\n\nDoes it have a deeper meaning? Absolutely!\n\nDoes it matter? No! It's a video game! Just enjoy it and stop worrying about what kind of subliminal messaging the developer is trying to inject into your subconscious...\n\nIf you're a fan of retro handheld RPGs with a 2-bit pixel art aesthetic but are tired of the same played-out, stereotypical, fantasy adventure, then be sure to pick up The Edge of Allegoria today for a refreshing take on the genre that influenced a generation!\n",
