	"description": "Mario Bros. is an action game released by Nintendo in 1983. \nIt's the first game that used \u201cMario\u201d in the title. \nControl Mario or Luigi in order to punch the enemies coming out of pipes from below to turn them over and then defeat them. In the two-player mode, both players can choose to work together or work against each other and enjoy the game in a myriad of ways.\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",
