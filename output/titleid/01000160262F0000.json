	"intro": "An action puzzle game starring Carbuncle. Use left and right movement and jumping to collect the gems on the map!",
	"description": "This game is essentially a Carbuncle version of the action-puzzle game 'Nyanpi,' which featured a cat protagonist and was included in 'Disk Station #24,' released by Compile in 1991. Players control Carbuncle to collect all the gems placed on the map, and then proceed to the girl's location to reach the goal and advance to the next stage.\n\nWhile the game rules are straightforward, conquering the game requires certain techniques. You must carefully consider Carbuncle's movements, taking into account jump power and the route, sometimes even using the gems as footholds!\n\nSince there is no game over due to a time limit and you can restart any number of times, this title allows you to settle in and play at your own pace. If you are a fan of puzzle games, you will definitely want to complete all 20 rounds.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
