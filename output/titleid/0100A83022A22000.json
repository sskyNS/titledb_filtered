	"description": "AN EPIC ADVENTURE IN AN ORIGINAL FANTASY WORLD\n\nTalamh has been shattered by a magical cataclysm caused by ambitious wizards, leaving magic mistrusted by the common folk. Sun King Azra took advantage of this panic, enslaving wizards through his Crimson Order and placing loyal princes to rule over the conquered realms.\nAs Azra\u2019s forces claim more and more lands, the high enchantress Uchawi and a small group of rebels rise from the shadows, wielding forbidden magic to challenge his oppressive regime and defy his absolute magic power.\n\nFROM THE DESTRUCTION, NEW HEROES RISE\n\nMeet the outcast heroes of Talamh, each with their unique fighting style.\nFrom the shadows of Yeldrim, Galandra emerges as an unstoppable force of nature. Her colossal sword strikes with deadly precision, combined with chilling, destructive necromantic powers. Her calm demeanor is a thin veil, barely concealing the furious anger brewing inside her.\nKarl is the last free dwarf of Talamh. Armed with an ancestral blunderbuss and his bare fists, he\u2019s a master of close-range brawls and explosive tactics. What he lacks in reach at mid-range, he makes up for with raw strength and quick thinking, making him a stalwart ally in the revolt against Azra's oppression.\nDuring their ordeals, two mysterious heroes will join them on a quest to overthrow the Sun King: Brome, a wizard prodigy on a mission to preserve the future generations of his people, and the enigmatic Cider, a nimble skirmisher in search of answers among the scattered fragments of their own soul.\n\nTHE ROGUE \u2018EM UP ORIGINAL BY DOTEMU\n\nAbsolum combines Dotemu and Guard Crush\u2019s mastery in beat \u2018em up gameplay with Supamonks' best-in-class art and animation. With its fast-paced action and endless replayability, Absolum will challenge you with multiple paths to explore and unpredictable encounters for a new experience each time you play.\n\nA NEW THRILLING GAMEPLAY TO MASTER\n\nTake down Azra\u2019s elite guard with a mix of rapid combo chains and spellcasting powers, unleashing moves that feel as raw as they are strategic. Use magical counters and rare items to turn the tide in your favor and experience a combat system that demands skill and timing, pushing you to craft new strategies at every run to wreak havoc among the enemy ranks.\n\nTHE BEAT \u2018EM UP GENRE AT ITS VERY BEST\n\nLead the uprising against Azra's regime as a lone hero, or team up with a friend on your couch or online. Combine your elemental powers and synchronize your attacks into incredible chained combos!\n\nThe world of Talamh is an intricate tapestry brimming with secrets, stories, and betrayals. From the majestic mines of Grandery to the lush forests of Jaroba, every step of your odyssey will be accompanied by a magnificent soundtrack by composer Gareth Coker (Ori, Halo Infinite, Prince of Persia), with collaborations from Yuka Kitamura (Dark Souls, Elden Ring), Mick Gordon (Doom Eternal, Atomic Heart), and more!",
