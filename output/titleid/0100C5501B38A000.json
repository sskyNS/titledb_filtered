	"description": "Brain Show: Who is the smartest one in your crew?\n\nBrain Show is a quiz game spiced with some mean, but harmless humor. Immerse in the world of classic game shows: choose your categories, answer questions, eliminate rivals in various challenges, and prove yourself to be the smartest one in the pack!\n\nUp to 8 players\nOver 5 000 questions in 41 categories\n13 competitions with entirely different rules\nCharismatic, funny (and a little cringy) host commenting your actions.\n\nControls in Brain Show were designed on a test group consisting of my chihuahua and a blind, 22 years old cat. So don\u2019t worry if some of your friends have never played any game in their lives, someone drank one too many, or you have this one peculiar fellow in the group\u2026 You just hand out pads, launch the game and have fun from the get-go. No manual or explanation needed!\n\nWelcome to a TV game show for people who are ashamed to admit that they have always dreamt about participating in one! Stand on a stage, take part in various challenges, such as the Stealing Points Round or Eliminations, play for a stake, and get annoyed by the weird host (because there is no game show without someone like me!).\nAnd since we\u2019re talking about me. I admit, I will throw some shade at you, but also tell you a good word (if you deserve it!). Always remember \u2013 my only purpose is to bring you loads of laughs (and a little bit of cringe).\n\nGame available in English and Polish.\n\nGet Brain Show and join the fun!",
