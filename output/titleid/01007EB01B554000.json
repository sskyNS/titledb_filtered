	"description": "REMEDIUM: Sentinels is a roguelite fast-paced auto-shooter that is set in the same world as REMEDIUM game. It has been more than a hundred years since the Grey Plague has won turning most humans into vicious mutant freaks, and only a handful of cities still stand amidst the death and chaos that consumed the land.\n\nYou control a Sentinel created by alchemists with only one goal - defend the cities against the endless hordes of mutants until your reactor dies. Combine items and alchemical elements to acquire more and more weapons and create unique builds!\n\nKey Features:\n\nEasy to play, hard to master\n\nNavigate your Sentinel through hordes of deadly mutants while it obliterates the enemies with its weapons!\n\nCollect Prime Matter to upgrade the Sentinel\n\nCombine weapons and items to enhance them with new elemental effects\n\nSurvive the onslaught until the Sentinel's reactor runs out!\n\nFace and defeat powerful Bosses\n\nComplete dozens of challenges and unlock new powers\n\nWide selection of guns and skills created by the art of alchemy\n\nTactically upgrade on the go or thoughtfully create character builds to fend off mutants with different perks and resistances\n\nThe longer you last, the stronger you become - gaining access to even more skills, weapons and enemies to defeat. Simply put, insane replayability!",
