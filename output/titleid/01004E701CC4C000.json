	"intro": "Gatewalkers is a unique mixture of co-op game, survival and RPG. You, as a Gatewalkers, travel across different worlds in order to save your own.",
	"description": "During your journey through the gates, you will face various dangers and all you can depend on are your reflexes, the ability to move around the battlefield, the plan your actions, and good timing of casting combo spells. Enemies that you will face will require you to adjust your strategy and equipment. In Gatewalkers, with the change of your equipment comes a change of your fight style - all the skills are attributed to particular elements of your armor and weapons. You are what you wear!\n\nThe survival part of the game will expose RPG lovers to new challenges, which are rare in this genre. Looking for resources needed to craft new weapons, maintaining good mental health in the terrifying forest, managing your body temperature at the ice world, or caring for nutrition and hydration of the character are only some of the offered mechanics.\n\nYou can play Gatewalkers solo, or in cooperation with up to 4 players.\n\nGatewalkers features:\n\nTEAM CO-OP\n\nAs a Gatewalker, one of the chosen few, you can go through the Gate and explore the worlds that lay on the other side. Team up with up to 3 other players in this team-based survival. Fight terrifying monsters, survive extreme weather conditions, follow the orders given by the Guild, and most importantly, stay alive!\n\nWORLD EXPLORATION\n\nExplore the procedurally generated worlds with unique terrain features, plants, and creatures. Discover new resources and crafting materials. Face various environmental hazards: toxic or unbreathable atmosphere, terrifying darkness, penetrating cold, and much more. Each world type introduces a unique survival mechanic that forces you to adapt. Finding food, water or wood to start a fire may be impossible. Consider carefully what to bring with you on the expedition, as no one really knows what awaits on the other side of the Gate.\n\nTEAM SURVIVAL\n\nSurviving alone in an unknown world is really hard. But with teammates at your side, you at least stand a chance. Share the responsibilities: start a fire to let others warm up, build a tent to let your mates rest, warn them about the dangers lurking in the night. The key to surviving is cooperation between you and your team.\n\nSKILL BASED COMBAT\n\nIsometric skill-based combat without auto targeting. Your skills may miss, and you can dodge enemy attacks! Good positioning during combat, balanced use of skills, proper timing and team synergy are all crucial to victory.\n\nCRAFTING\n\nChoose an item to craft. Discover the appropriate recipe. Raid different worlds to gather required resources. Find or create a crafting station. Finally, build the item and use it!\n\nYOU ARE WHAT YOU WEAR\n\nThere are no predefined character classes. Each item gives you a unique set of skills, so try tinkering with different builds. Take heavy armor and a healing staff to support your mates in the front line by tanking and restoring health. Remember, you are, what you wear!\n\nPROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLDS\n\nEach time you pass the Gate you will land in a different, procedurally generated world. This gives you countless opportunities, offers constant challenges, and forces you to adapt in order to win in changing conditions! Always stay cautious, modify your strategy, make fast decisions and face their consequences, because you never know what waits around the corner.",
