	"intro": "In this world, what you do not see ceases to exist. Will you master the power of perception and call the moon back?",
	"description": "Is the moon there when nobody looks?\nEinstein once asked this famous question about quantum mechanics.\nThis game takes that idea and turns it into a mysterious puzzle RPG, where the world itself only exists when you see it.\n\nAt first glance Cassette Boy looks like a charming pixel-style adventure, but beneath the surface lies something far more complex.\nWhat seems like a flat 2D pixel world is in fact a three-dimensional space. By rotating the environment, the boundaries of existence shift. What comes into view becomes real, and what slips away from sight fades into nothingness.\n\nTo solve puzzles you\u2019ll need to twist and turn the map, revealing hidden paths or making obstacles disappear simply by shifting your perspective. Anything concealed from your view is erased from reality. A wall that blocks your way can vanish, while a secret passage can suddenly emerge.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about solving puzzles. You\u2019ll gather weapons, face monsters, and challenge powerful bosses as you uncover the secrets of this strange and fragile world. Every fight and every puzzle pushes you deeper into the mystery of existence itself.\n\n\nStory:\n\n\u201cThe moon is gone.\nIt slipped away when you looked aside.\nAnd now the world begins to crumble.\nWhen you turn away, the things that matter most fade into nothing.\nSo keep your eyes open.\nCome, let us seek the moon\u201d\n\nYou awaken in a world of darkness, guided only by a glowing orb. It whispers the truth: what you cannot see does not exist. The moon has disappeared because you looked away, and without it the world is breaking apart. You are the one who must find it.\n\nWith this secret revealed, you set out on a journey where absence and presence are one and the same. To bring the moon back, you must learn to master the very nature of existence.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nUnseen = Uncertain.\nIn Cassette Boy, the \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger System\u201d ensures that anything you can\u2019t see simply doesn\u2019t exist. That person you just spoke to? The switch you were about to press? If they leave the screen, they\u2019re gone.\n\nRotation-Based Mechanics.\nThe game world is built in 3D, and you\u2019ll rotate the map to change what\u2019s visible. This changes the way puzzles are solved in ways you've never experienced.\n\nPerspective as Gameplay.\nYour viewpoint isn't just cosmetic\u2014it's a core mechanic. Ordinary camera movement becomes the key to solving mind-bending puzzles.\n\nA Retro Look with a Modern Twist.\nIt may look nostalgic, but every twist of this game offers something completely new, a surreal experience that plays with reality itself.",
