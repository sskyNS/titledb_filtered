Master these skills to suppress the oncoming enemies!  \nThe game features multiple modes: \n\"Story Mode\", which unfolds with full voice and visual scenes.\n\"Arcade Mode\", focusing purely on shooting action.\n\"Score Attack Mode\", where players compete for high scores within a time limit.\n\"Boss Rush Mode\", where players battle against a series of bosses.\nAdditionally, the original\u2019s sensual scenes have been thoughtfully adapted for a modern revival, respecting the heroines' privacy while maintaining the essence of the classic.\n\n\u25c6 Saturn Tribute brings powerful new features to fully support players!  \nEnjoy modern convenience with:  \nThe \"Rewind\" function, allowing players to go back and retry scenes after mistakes.\nThe \"Save & Load\" function, letting players save and revisit their favorite moments.\nAdditional features include:  \n\"guide display\" for item lists on the side of the screen.\n\"carry-over weapon system\", allowing players to keep their weapons after clearing stages (not in the original).\nAn \"extra durability boost\" for the player character.\n*While the in-game menu supports both \"Japanese and English\", some in-game text and voiceovers remain \"Japanese only\".  \n\n\u25c6 What is \"STEAM-HEART'S\"?  \nOriginally released as a PC game in 1994, \"STEAM-HEART'S\" became a hit with its combination of numerous visual scenes featuring heroines and an engaging shooting gameplay experience. \nThis version is based on the 1998 home console release, bringing the classic back with modern enhancements.
