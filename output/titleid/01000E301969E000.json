	"intro": "A super exhilarating Metroidvania action game full of hilarious dialogue and comical encounters!",
	"description": "A new superweapon has been developed by the evil organization Animalia.\n\nEnter Tomomi, a hero for hire. Joining her is Riko, the supporter. Their mission...infiltrate the Animalia complex and stop their evil plans!\n\nTomomi is combat savvy but a bit of an airhead, a quality that can really tick Riko off. Will Tomomi and Riko be able to find and destroy the new weapon!?\n\nMetroidvania side-scrolling action:\nThe Animalia complex is vast, containing many unique areas. There are research facilities, an observatory, an industrial mill, and even a shop just to name a few. Naturally, there are hidden areas as well. Explore them all with Tomomi's abilities in this Metroidvania-style game as you pummel any enemy that stands in your way. From simple jumps to transforming into an animal, to swinging from the ceiling like Tarzan, there's no secret you can't find!\n\nFight huge bosses:\nTomomi is about 170 cm tall, but pales in comparison to the bosses, some of which exceed 20 meters! But do not despair, Tomomi's body may be small (although some parts are quite large), but it is powered by love and justice to overcome any enemy!\n\nBecome the strongest hero ever:\nThere are almost 20 different kinds of upgrades. Some can be bought at a shop, others are obtained by defeating bosses, and a few are in hidden areas. Once you find them all, Tomomi's movement will transcend the limits of gravity and physics.\n\nConversations and the power of love:\nHumorous conversations take place throughout the game, ranging from taunting the bosses to Tomomi and Riko's small talk, their history, and much more. In one of them, Tomomi reveals she is in love with Riko. Will Riko give in to the power of love to power up Tomomi? (Probably not.)",
