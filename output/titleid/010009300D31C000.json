	"intro": "The adorable Squidgies need your help to conquer the galaxy in this puzzle game full of diverse powerups, levels, and challenges!",
	"description": "You control the Squidgies, hapless little blobs of adorableness, that need your help to escape their Momma's tentacles and make their new home on planets across the galaxy. \n\nFind creative solutions to each level's puzzles by making the Squidgies swing, fling, float, splat, stretch into tubes, and turn metallic. Some Squidgie powers can be combined together for even more mind-bending puzzle-solving techniques!\n\nGet enough Squidgies into the portal, and you'll takeover all three planets \u2014 enough room for even the most active Squidgie. Are you skilled enough to conquer them all? Try hard enough, you might even find some bonus planets to invade.\n\nThere are over 80 levels (and more on the way), each with their own unique feats to complete and highscores to beat.\n\nThere's more replayability than you can shake a Squidgie at. Note: please don't shake the Squidgies \u2014 they're sensitive!",
