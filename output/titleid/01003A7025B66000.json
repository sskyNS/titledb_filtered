	"description": "Enter the world of Legacy of Shnaus - Horror Room Escape, a psychological first-person horror where you explore an abandoned clinic filled with secrets, tragic memories, and experiments that should never have existed. As a journalist searching for the truth behind mysterious disappearances, you step inside a place marked by grief, obsession, and the shadow of the doctor who once worked there. Every room hides clues to a forgotten story, every sound pushes you deeper into fear, and the only way forward is to uncover the legacy left behind.\n\nWhat begins as an investigation becomes a struggle for survival when you encounter the two forces that haunt the clinic - the ghost of Liza, trapped between innocence and suffering, and Subject Zero, the final experiment born from a desperate father\u2019s mind. With no weapons and nowhere safe, you must solve puzzles, follow the traces of the past, and escape a place where reality breaks under the weight of trauma. Your path to freedom is built from fragments of truth - and the clinic never forgets.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n-First-person psychological horror experience in a decaying clinic\n- Story-driven exploration with hidden rooms and secret passages\n- Two hostile entities that shape the atmosphere and progression\n- Environmental puzzles that reveal the past piece by piece\n- Suspenseful survival moments where silence is your only protection\n- A haunting narrative about loss, obsession, and forbidden science\n\nThe truth isn\u2019t just buried - it\u2019s alive. Face the Legacy of Shnaus and escape before the past closes in.",
