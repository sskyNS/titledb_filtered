	"description": "\"3 people will lose themselves\nMy soul will join them in the end\"\n\nNoah finds himself being lonely, pressured by other people and generally lost. He doesn't show up for a date he had planned, nor to do his job, not even to see his doctor. The man doesn't know how to deal with anything that goes his way, and to find any fulfillment and change in his life he decides and finds a way to take 3 lives, while also joining them as the 4th one.\nAs horrible as that sounds, Noah discovers it is not that easy to take innocent lives, because his main obstacle is his own heart and conscience. Why would he even do any of this in the first place?\n\nThis story driven game features psychological horror, creepy atmosphere, gun combat, inventory system, various enemies, boss fights, extra narratives along the main storyline and it is partially a remake of the very first Timore game, with a full new tale about Noah - a man on the edge of his sanity, conscience and fears.",
