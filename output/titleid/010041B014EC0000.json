	"description": "After getting sad-drunk with a biker-wizard, you, the protagonist of our story, have woken up with a ghost in your bed! Her ghostly tail is chained to your leg and she's just as scared as you are! You can shake and rattle and yell and kick and scream all you like, but there's only one way to set the poor thing free. You've got to fall in love with her. The feeling doesn't have to be mutual.\n\nIs it worth it to fall in love with someone who will leave you? Did you ever have a choice in the matter? Can you at least try to have some fun while it lasts? Or is it simply too hard to let go?",
