	"description": "Start your driving adventure on a beautiful island! When you feel warmed up, mix things up and hop into a sports car, quad bike or even a massive bus. This is a racing game that will bring the sun into your life!\n\nFEATURES:\n\u25b6 13 UNIQUE CARS: Dune buggy, food truck, circus truck and more!\n\u25b6 MULTIPLE EXCITING CHALLENGES: Pass all of the missions in style!\n\u25b6 FREE ROAMING MODE: Explore the area at your own pace\n\u25b6 REALISTIC TRAFFIC: Find your rhythm around narrow, overcrowded passes\n\u25b6 BEAUTIFUL OUTDOOR LOCATION: Climb uphill roads, drift on sandy beaches\n\nDrive through narrow mountain roads, drift across sandy beaches and venture offroad as you try to beat your high score. Become the fastest driver around!\n\nThe game features a wide and varied selection of cars. You start out in a fast and maneuverable dune buggy, but during the course of the game you will also drive bigger and more demanding vehicles (a food truck will not be the biggest of your problems!). By the time you reach a whole circus truck, you should be well enough versed in the intricacies of the gameplay to effectively react to every surprise the tracks may throw at you!\n\nNarrow mountain roads are problematic in and of themselves, even without the traffic. Well, we\u2019ve got traffic too, so be prepared to turn your driving skills up to 11! Not only you will have to overtake vehicles left on the side of the road, but you will also have to find your rhythm around narrow, overcrowded passess.\n\nYou will drive around a tropical island where the mountains meet the sea. Regardless of where you take your car you can be sure the view will be worth it!",
