	"description": "Playing latest games is like work.\nGetting together with friends, fighting bosses\u2014that\u2019s all cool, but having some time for yourself is pretty awesome too.\nThere are times we like to spend some time alone having fun, and taking on challenges in a game is an awesome way to do just that.\n\nALPHA, the latest work by KANAME, is a simple game. There are no additional in-game purchases: once it's yours, you can begin tackling it until you reach the end. Maybe it\u2019s time to take a break from playing games for other people.\n\n\u25c6 Key features of ALPHA\n\n\u25ce\u3000A single-player action shooting game. Quite a challenging one, in fact.\n\u25ce\u3000Average play time of 2 hours (or, if you like to spend more time, as long as you want)\n\u25ce\u3000Knock off enemy bullets with your sword to shoot and slash your way through stages.\n\u25ce\u3000No save points during stages. Enemies are tough, and so are the bosses. Study their moves and work around them.\n\u25ce\u3000When it\u2019s game over, you start over from the beginning of the stage. You won\u2019t be getting it easy!\n\u25ce\u3000Some health items, shields, bombs, etc. are just a few useful items.\n\u25ce\u3000All this for a small price.",
