	"description": "Mortisomem is an adventure, mystery, and horror game with retro visual aesthetics. The game takes place in the year 1917, in the vast forest of inland Brazil.\n\nDonald Barnes is an immigrant and a successful American merchant in Brazil. However, one day he hears a traditional story from the region that greatly captures his attention; about a man who lived hundreds of years ago, brutally murdered by his wife's family, and who, after his death, became a cruel demon that kills the inhabitants of that area out of hatred and resentment. This demon was called Mortisomem.\n\nHowever, on his way back home, Donald Barnes begins to be stalked by a powerful and horrifying creature that perfectly matches the physical descriptions of Mortisomem. The American merchant is forced to venture further into rural areas to escape this creature and find another way home.\n\nExplore the forests of inland Brazil, meet people, uncover the region's history, and escape from Mortisomem alive.\n\nFeatures:\n- Medium-length game: Around 1 hour to unlock an ending, depending on the player's skill\n- Great atmosphere and aesthetics: Amazing rural and nighttime settings with a wide variety of effects, sounds, and retro graphics\n- Open-World Map: A rich world full of interactions and secrets with the freedom to explore\n- Multiple Endings: Player decisions can lead to different outcomes",
