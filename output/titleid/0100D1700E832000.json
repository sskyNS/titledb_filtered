	"intro": "Eliza is a story about an AI therapist, the people who develop it, and the people who use it.",
	"description": "After abandoning her high-powered tech career and a mysterious three-year absence, Evelyn Ishino-Aubrey resurfaces working as a proxy for a virtual counseling app called Eliza. Her job consists solely of reading a script provided to her in real-time by an AI, leaving her no autonomy over what she says. Is Eliza a technological marvel that brings therapy to those who otherwise couldn\u2019t access it? Or is it an ineffective replacement and another vector for technology companies to gain control over our lives and humanity?\n\nAs she reconnects with people from her past and gets to know the ordinary people of Seattle who use Eliza for counseling, Evelyn finds herself caught in the middle between differing sides of the argument\u2014 and as she begins to question everything about her past life and future purpose in the world, it becomes clear she must confront the turmoil and darkness inside.\n\n\u2022 A thought-provoking story told in the form of a visual novel from an award-winning indie team.\n\n\u2022 Follow Evelyn\u2019s journey through a present-day Seattle brought to life with beautiful hand-painted art.\n\n\u2022 Get to know Eliza\u2019s clients and the employees of Skandha, the technology giant behind it, with over a dozen fully-voiced characters and powerful performances from a highly regarded cast.\n\n\u2022 An evocative, ambient original score by the composer for Infinifactory, SHENZHEN I/O, Opus Magnum, and EXAPUNKS.\n\n\u2022 Is AI-driven counseling better than nothing? Is it worse than nothing? What responsibilities come with technical skills? Consider your own answers to these questions and more.\n\n\u2022 Counseling sessions getting a little too real? Relax with Kabufuda Solitaire, a new take on solitaire using Japanese kabufuda cards.",
