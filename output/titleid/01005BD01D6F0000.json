	"description": "Muv-Luv Alternative is a direct sequel to Muv-Luv Unlimited, and is the grand finale of the Muv-Luv saga. \nStep back into the cockpit and prepare for deployment in Muv-Luv Alternative, the most critically acclaimed visual novel of all time.\nThis isn\u2019t a cutesy high school rom-com anymore; it\u2019s an epic tale of conspiracies, an alien menace, quantum causality, and much, much more. It\u2019ll test your limits, challenge your worldview, and by the time it\u2019s all over, you\u2019ll be so emotionally spent that it\u2019ll be weeks before you can fully process the implications of what you\u2019ve just witnessed.\nThis definitive remastered release comes with a brand-new interface, so if you think you\u2019re ready to take the dive, there\u2019s never been a better time to strap in and see for yourself why so many readers consider this the greatest story ever told.\n\n\u2014-Story\u2014-\nThree years have passed since the day Takeru suddenly awoke in a world not his own \u2014 a war-torn alternate reality in which mankind was locked in a decades-long struggle against the ruthless extraterrestrial invaders known as the BETA. In that time, he\u2019s been through an awful lot \u2014 enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his old friends, and even falling in love. \nBut it seems that fate has bigger plans for Takeru, because after a disastrous failure, he wakes up to find himself back in his childhood bedroom once again. Not in his own world, mind you \u2014 but back where he was three years prior. This is no dream; this is a recurring nightmare. But then it hits him: this is a second chance. Perhaps he can use his knowledge to warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. If he can change history, then maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 he\u2019ll find the answers to all of his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn\u2019t Sumika here? And most importantly, what IS Alternative IV?",
