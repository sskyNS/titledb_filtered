	"description": "It's time to take a drive on the Furry Road! Funtasia is a side-scrolling, 2D racing game where the goal is simple: Drive as fast as possible to reach the finish line. Help save the beautiful, ecologically sustainable world of Funtasia and its furry inhabitants from certain death beneath tons of garbage dumped on it from space.\n\nSimple to pick up and play, yet challenging to truly master, Funtasia is all about timing and balance. The race track ripples, with hills, pits, bridges, quicksand, cliffs, and caves separating you from the finish line. Reaching the finish line requires balancing gas, brakes, and the car itself, just right (drivers do not enjoy meeting hard surfaces face-first at a hundred KPH, nor do doctors recommend it).\n\nOh, and keep in mind that there's no stopping, there's only going really, really fast. Breaks are for cowards. The car's battery isn't known for its lifespan!\n\n\nSave Funtasia, a paradise full of furry animals, from an apocalyptic wave of garbage by driving really, really fast over 10 fantastical tracks.\nMaster 40 different cars, with their own performance, challenges, and idiosyncrasies!\nSurvive boss fights with foes equal parts twisted and dastardly.\nBrave the Furry Road all alone or as a duo with Cooperative or Challenge modes.\nChallenge players across the world in online leaderboards to claim the top spot in going fast\nExperience a fanciful art style by Italian artist Emanuele Olives drawing inspirations from Heinz Edelmenn\u2019s work on Adventure Time, and Troma.\n",
