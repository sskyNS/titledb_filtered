	"description": "\"I remember getting the call vividly. I was trying to finish up for the day, but a stack of paperwork was keeping me late. To be honest, I was also looking for reasons not to go home. My phone rang, I answered it, and the director of the institute was talking, albeit disjointedly, about something that had turned up in a recent survey of The Sirena Deep.\"\n\nOVERVIEW\nExplore a mysterious, abandoned underwater facility at the bottom of the Mariana trench. Who built it? What was it used for? Perhaps you will find answers, or perhaps the answers will find you.\n\nTHIS IS A SHORT GAME\nYou can play through The Sirena Expedition in about an hour. However, there may be some hidden content, for those willing to look for it.\n\n\u2219 A 2.5D platformer with retro-inspired visuals.\n\u2219 Tense underwater atmosphere and horror.\n\u2219 Innovative puzzle mechanics.\n\u2219 Fully voiced dialogue.\n\u2219 Original soundtrack by beee girlll & Giraffe Cat.",
