Your goal is to find the 3 hidden heads and escape the horror of the show.\n\nYou're the current contestant in a twisted game environment designed by Billy himself, for his own twisted enjoyment. Billy's Game Show set is made for you to choose your own path, but remember, it\u2019s Billy's game, and he sets the rules. He will challenge you with traps, hidden paths, different puzzles, and most importantly, three generators which need you to consistently keep an eye open, otherwise, they will eliminate you.\n\nGame Mechanics:\n- Choose your own path to advance.\n- Avoid being caught by Billy, or hide when he comes.\n- Do your tasks quietly and out of sight.\n- Billy's set is full of traps, so be aware at all times.\n- Manage your inventory smartly, do not overload it.\n- Make sure the three main generators are running smoothly.",
