	"description": "I am a Falconeye who graduated from the Disolance Falconeye Academy, but merely a so-called one that hasn't got any practical experience before. So, I came to the distant border of the Kingdom of Disolance \u2014\u2014 the Doe region, where I would set off to become a real adventurer in the town of Garlant.\nDisregarding its perilous surrounding, Garlant is a quiet, peaceful place to live in. I hope I can befriend the villagers and start my new town life smoothly. Of course, I won't forget my mission as a Falconeye, that is, to improve myself with every resource and technique that I can get, and work with the Doe Guild to restore safety and harmony to nearby areas.\n\nBeat monsters up, take levels down\nAccording to the information provided by the Doe Guild, the Doe region has long been occupied by a large variety of monsters that roam in different areas. Only by defeating the dominant BOSS there can we secure the area, so taking them down one by one is a long haul for the Doe Guild to accomplish.\nWhat is concerning is that there are rumors about the mysterious ancient technology and an Falconeye group that has gone missing. Everything seems like being shrouded in a thick layer of fog.\n\nCraft equipment and augments\nThe Kingdom of Disolance is known for its outstanding artisans and craftsmanship. Using my knowledge, I can create different processing machines, which will come in handy in crafting useful tools with the resources I gathered, along with gems to augment my equipment.\nBut one can never be too prepared. When searching for the missing adventure group, I found more unknown crafting recipes, and they are worth looking into.\n\nBuild a manor, live a wonderful life\nTo live my own life in the Garlant, I decided to build a manor.\nDuring my adventure, I have collected all kinds of seeds and tried to grow them in different ways. Tend to my crops till a harvest, then I can sell them out, use them for crafting or fulfill other villagers' requests.\nFrom time to time, I get to hang around the town and visit my friends. I\u2019ve built a lot of friendship in the Garlant, perhaps in here \u2026 I can find the one to spend my life with.",
