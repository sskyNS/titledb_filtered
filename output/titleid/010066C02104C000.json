	"description": "This is an action RPG released in 1986 in Japan. As a chosen traveler, the player's goal is to defeat the beasts and restore peace to Babylon.\n\nThe game features a side-view action RPG style. Players attack enemies by dashing into them while utilizing various items (magic) to fight. Depending on your positioning, it's even possible to attack enemies directly above you. Mastering this technique can make battles more efficient. Additionally, the game allows you to adjust the speed across four levels, so if fast-paced action isn't your strong suit, you can play at your preferred pace.\n\nThere's no money or shop system, and players progress by collecting scattered items and magic across the wide map, offering a simple and accessible gameplay experience. However, weapons and shields are automatically equipped upon discovery, so be sure to compare new items with your current gear before picking them up. If you do accidentally equip the wrong item, you can re-enter the room to re-equip your previous gear, so no worries!\n\nIn this game, you\u2019ll explore the field, power up with hidden items and magic, and defeat beasts. Despite its simplicity, the smooth action makes for an enjoyable experience.\n\nFor a nostalgic touch, the game manual even includes plenty of monster illustrations. Looking at these vintage-style images before playing is sure to get you in the right mood!\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
