	"description": "The story revolves around a capricious, spoiled girl named Ingrid. She steps on a loaf of bread to avoid getting her shoes dirty and tumbles all the way down to hell. \n\nThe underworld is teeming with creepy creatures. Some of them want to swallow little Ingrid whole, others want to torment her with never-ending nightmares, and still others want to turn her into a charming statue to impress their neighbors.\n\nBut, when it seems like Ingrid is doomed to perish in this infernal pit, she meets Molek, a talkative, sarcastic demon who has been watching her adventure with fascination. She has no choice but to trust the little demon. Who knows? He just might be the key to her redemption and a way home.\n\nFeatures:\n- Multiple endings. Ingrid's fate depends entirely on your choices and the actions you perform over the course of the entire game\n- Gripping puzzles that incorporate a wide variety of mechanics\n- An immersive, fully-voiced storyline with references to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, the Brothers Grimm, and other authors.",
