	"description": "A castaway stuck on a deserted island scrounges for the last bits of food he can find. On the edge of death, he wakes up one night and realizes that a fully stocked, fully functional fast food restaurant has appeared on his tiny island paradise. Shocked and confused at the sight, he wanders into the nightmare that is Manny's, a restaurant with employees who act as if nothing is out of the ordinary, one bloodthirsty patron, and a mysterious manager who calls out from the bowels of the restaurant itself. Will this castaway get his last meal, or will he become the meal?",
