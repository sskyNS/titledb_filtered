	"description": "Tiny Watermelon Match presents the reverse evolution of a classic watermelon game, where players, stack various fruits in a confined space to earn points without letting any fruit breach the top boundary. To prevent overflow, players must strategically merge fruits of the same type, starting with coveted Watermelon and gradually decreasing their size.\n\nFeaturing eleven fruits ranging from watermelon to cherry, the game follows a specific size progression, limiting players to dropping only the five LARGEST fruits at any given time. Although the order of available fruits is random, players can anticipate the next fruit in line.\n\nThe game also incorporates an online leaderboard for players to compare their scores based on Seasons, with the option to track personal progress and view the full leaderboard rankings.  Can you master the art of fruit pairing and reach the top of the global leaderboard?\n\nGame modes:\n(a) Classic - reverse watermelon game rule.\n(b) Classic Time Attack - 300 seconds.\n(c) Arcade - new feature, swap fruits and random bomb drops.\n(d) Arcade Time Attack - 300 seconds.\n\nHours of fun and challenge your friends for the highest score for each play mode on four leaderboards!",
