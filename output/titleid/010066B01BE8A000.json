	"description": "Burn trees, buildings, vehicles, and tiny screaming humans. Dodge bullet-hell rain clouds and pissed-off firefighters to stay alive.\n\nDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll burn unopposed. Mother nature has sent in a bullet-hell array of rain clouds and other obstacles to put an end to your destruction fest. Your flame must weave through the storm to survive. Firefighting helicopters, planes, and little firemen will also be out to get you. The more you burn their buildings the more pissed off they get (and the more combo points you get!)\n\nThis is a Rogue-lite game so each run is different. However, we still maintain a sense of progression with persistent level up points. This means you get stronger, even if you die 5000 times.\n\nForest Fires aren\u2019t just limited to trees\u2026 light whole groups of people on fire, explode helicopters out of the sky, and burn famous monuments. Your destruction has no boundaries and is unimpeded by morality.\n\nThe forest is vast and unending, with a myriad of secrets hidden within her.\nFeatures\n-5 unique levels\n-3 Game Modes: Main Quest, Endless Mode, and Insane Mode\n-Roguelite style perma-death\n-Dozens of painful bullet hell patterns\n-Unlockables and persistent level-up system\n-30+ Achievements and persistent stats\n-Dozens of secrets; characters, monuments, and oddities\n\n...And all this for less than the price of a burrito! Are you ready to burn?",
