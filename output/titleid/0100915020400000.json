	"description": "Cabernet is a 2D narrative RPG set in a 19th century Eastern European inspired world, with a modern twist. Guide Liza, a young vampire struggling with her morality and the supernatural world she has been pulled into. Will you retain your humanity or descend further into the horror you have become? Prepare to explore a hidden world of political intrigue, class conflict, and decadent corruption.\n\nUse the moonlit sky to plan your next feast and explore. Mingle among vampiric society and the humans who feed them. Uncover who can aid your new kin and whose only purpose is to be drained.  \n\nVampirism isn't just an unholy transformation of your body-- it also threatens to transform your mind. Will you choose to indulge your empathetic humanity or embrace your newfound nihilism?\n\nBut to lure your next meal somewhere safe and secluded, you'll need to understand who they are and what they desire. A kind-hearted, alcoholic coachman? A fraying newlywed couple? A greedy, yet charming charlatan? Their lives are yours to aid or unravel.\n\nArt, literature, history, science, these are the skills you'll require to succeed. Your knowledge will be your greatest weapon in a world where the cunning drain the brutal of life.",
