Options to show where to go next and check your progress so far mean you'll never get stuck.\n\nOften described as a mix of minesweeper and picross, each clue number shows how many squares in a block of nine - the clue itself, plus the eight squares around it - should be filled in black.\n\nYou only need to learn this one rule to start playing Fill-a-Pix but to make sure you understand all the techniques, a full interactive tutorial is included!\n\nPuzzles are designed by Conceptis Ltd - the world's leading supplier of logic puzzles.",
