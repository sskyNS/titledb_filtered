	"description": "\"WARP & WARP\" is an action game released by NAMCO (Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.) in 1981. Players travel between two worlds as they progress: a space world where they fight with guns, and a maze world where they fight with time bombs. Try for a high score by taking down the MYSTERY BEM that spawn under set conditions, or by taking out multiple enemies with a single explosion!\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.\n\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
