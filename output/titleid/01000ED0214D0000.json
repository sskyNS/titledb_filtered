	"description": "Staffer Case is a new sort of mystery game, asking players to find clues, arrange them into documents, and point out the contradictions between them to solve a series of murders.\n\nThe game is set in a fictional version of London in the 1960s where 10% of all residents have some sort of supernatural ability. In this city, incidents involving staffers, the people who have these abilities, are constantly occurring.\n\nPlayers take the role of the Mana Affairs Division's newest detective, Notrick, in order to make sense of these incidents. Since the tricks buried within these staffer cases, at their core, revolve around the supernatural abilities of these criminals, conventional investigative methods won't be enough to solve them. Instead, players will have to rely on the documents that explain what their suspects' abilities entail in order to make sense of everything.",
