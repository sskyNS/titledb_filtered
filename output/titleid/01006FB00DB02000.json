	"description": "Smash, clobber and bash the murderous legends of Slavic mythology in this darkly funny action role-playing game that changes every time you play. Play as Ivan, a one-handed blacksmith with incredibly bad luck, who must take on the impossible tasks given to him by the tzar. All the while the mysterious witch, Baba Yaga, watches over Ivan\u2019s fate. \n\nThe world of Yaga is a world steeped in Slavic folklore and ancient Pagan beliefs. Featuring a head-bobbing Romanian hip-hop soundtrack from Subcarpa\u021bi and striking, hand-drawn 2D artwork. Yaga is an authentic love letter to childhood fables from Romanian indie developer, Breadcrumbs Interactive.\n\n\u25cf Bludgeon the ancient monsters of Slavic folklore using a vast arsenal of hammers and tools forged by Ivan\u2019s own hands.\n\u25cf Your actions change Ivan\u2019s story, his reputation, and the upgrades he can choose.\n\u25cf Experiment in the deep forging system to make weapons like teleporting lightning hammers and hookshot pitchforks.\n\u25cf Explore the combinations of talismans, magic items, blessings, perks, and curses to fundamentally change how Ivan plays.\n\u25cf Multiple endings, multiple ways of solving encounters, procedural map, lots of characters to encounter, and hidden secrets mean Yaga is meant to be played over and over again.\n\u25cf Ivan\u2019s grandma just wants him to find a wife. Don\u2019t disappoint her!",
