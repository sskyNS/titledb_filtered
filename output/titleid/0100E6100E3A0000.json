	"description": "Eight-Minute Empire, by Ryan Laukat, is a quick Civilization/Exploration game using card-driven area control.\n\nIn Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from the six displayed. This card gives the player a resource, and also has an action which the player takes immediately. Actions help players take over the map, but the resources are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects. Players spread across the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majority control in regions and continents.\n\n\u2022 Recruit troops to strengthen your army\n\u2022 Command your forces to acquire new provinces\n\u2022 Challenge your friends all over the world\n\u2022 Sail across the seas & build castles to expand your empire\n\u2022 Eliminate enemy troops to weaken your adversaries\n\u2022 Collect goods to increase your advantage[/list]\n\nAWARDS & HONORS\nOur digital adaptation: \n\n\u2022 2017 Golden Geek Best Board Game App Nominee\n\u2022 2017 Golden Geek Best Mobile/Handheld Nominee\n\nThe board game: \n\u2022 2013 Golden Geek Best Family Board Game Nominee\n\u2022 2013 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee\n\u2022 2014 Gioco dell\u2019Anno Nominee\n\u2022 2014 Hra roku Nominee\n\nEight-Minute Empire: Complete Edition features all additional content released to date: \n\u2022 Eight-Minute Empire base game\n\u2022 Mountains Expansion\n\u2022 Old Europe Map\n\u2022 Archipelago of Azra Map\n\u2022 Southern Plains Map\n\u2022 Starfall Crater Map\n\u2022 Isthmus of Gom Map\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 official Eight-Minute Empire game\n\u2022 great artwork\n\u2022 ingame interactive tutorial\n\u2022 languages: English, German, Dutch, Polish, French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese Traditional and Simplified, Russian\n\u2022 play with AI, with friends or both\n\u2022 pass and play mode\n\u2022 online cross platform multiplayer with synchronous and asynchronous modes\n\u2022 opponents' last moves replay\n\u2022 3 levels of difficulty AIs with individual strategies\n\u2022 different maps\n\u2022 ambient sounds and music\n\u2022 official rules plus extra additions\n\u2022 unique, original board game feel on your Nintendo Switch\u2122\n\u2022 colorblind mode\n\u2022 over 70 achievements",
