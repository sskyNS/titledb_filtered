	"intro": "Have a Nice Death is a 2D action roguelike where you play as an overworked Death, whose employees have run rampant, completely throwing off the balance of souls - and his vacation.",
	"description": "In order to restore order, you'll have to grab your trusty scythe and show your employees who's boss!\n\nDiscover and explore the darkly-charming, procedurally-generated departments of Death Inc., where you\u2019ll meet a diverse cast of memorable characters\u2014like your affable pumpkin-headed assistant, Pump Quinn\u2014who are always willing to share the latest office gossip.\n\nSharpen your skills (and scythe) through fast-paced hack n\u2019 slash combat, utilizing over 70 unique weapons and spells you can find and upgrade to create devastating combinations.\n\nSince Death can\u2019t die, use what you\u2019ve learned and earned to overcome the numerous minions and bosses in each department of Death Incorporated... over and over. A performance review after every run guarantees that you\u2019ll unlock interesting items and upgrades that will help you progress on your journey.\n\nTaking more power for yourself is a controversial move in Death Incorporated\u2019s company culture. For instance, adopting a Curse upgrade for yourself might result in the Labor Inspector granting your subordinates enhanced powers, or worse, raising the cost of koffee and other items that are vital to your work output.",
