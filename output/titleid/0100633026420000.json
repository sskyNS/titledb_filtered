	"description": "This is a puzzle game where you spin panels to align dogs facing in the correct direction.  \n\nThe controls are simple: carefully look at the puzzle image and tap the panel you want to rotate!  \nDepending on your clear time, you can earn 1 to 3 cute puppies.  \n\nIf you get stuck, you can use the hint button up to three times.  \nIt will automatically fix one row of panels to the correct orientation, so you can play without worry.  \n\nSimple yet surprisingly deep, it\u2019s perfect for short breaks.  \nAim for a 3-star clear on every stage and complete your Dog Encyclopedia!\n",
