	"description": "This is a real-time simulation game released in Japan by Nihon Falcom in 1991. It is the seventh installment in the Dragon Slayer series, but since it is not an RPG\u2014unlike most of the series\u2014it is known among fans as a unique title.\n\nThe player becomes the king and governs their country, with the goal of defeating all other nations. You issue commands to units to cultivate land, build houses, construct fences for defense, or build bridges to strengthen your base, while combining units to create armies. The stage is cleared by capturing the enemy\u2019s castle. After clearing a stage, stats rate are shown, so you can replay to aim for higher scores.\n\nThere are a total of 53 stages included. As the game progresses, the difficulty naturally increases, and visual elements like characters and themes change as well, allowing players to enjoy a fresh experience each time without getting bored.\n\nWith its fast pace and intense territorial battles, this game is a superb simulation title that can be recommended to a wide range of players.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
