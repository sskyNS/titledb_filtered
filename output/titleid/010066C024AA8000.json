	"description": "Build a castle by day and defend it by night. Becastled combines cozy city-building with thrilling tower defense strategy. Lead the Sun Kingdom in its final stand against the Moon beasts and bring an end to the ancient conflict between light and darkness!\nRule over your own fantasy realm.

Keep your subjects happy with taverns and decorations, and your economy strong with markets and workshops \u2014 all to support an army ready to fight at your command.\nThe countdown to war begins at dawn. There's not a moment to waste. Raise walls, station archers on the battlements, and mount ballistas and trebuchets atop your towers. Shape the terrain to your advantage, crafting layered defenses to withstand any assault.\nThe siege horns blare at sunset. How long will your fortress endure the night?\nBUILD A CASTLE BY DAY\nTransform a humble village into a thriving medieval city. Build farms and markets to keep your people fed and prosperous, and secure a steady flow of wood and iron. Raise walls and watchtowers, fortify the gates, and prepare your defenses for the siege to come. Adorn the streets with decorations to lift morale before the night falls. Develop a fantasy bastion where life flourishes under the sun!\nKEEP YOUR PEOPLE HAPPY\nSatisfied subjects work harder and fight with greater courage. Sawmills may sour the air, but lively taverns lift every spirit. Strike the right balance between comfort and function to keep your kingdom strong through each long night.\nDEFEND AGAINST A SIEGE AT NIGHT\nAs daylight fades, the Moon beasts grow bolder. They\u2019ll strike with battering rams, siege towers, and raging dragons. Defy their might with layered walls and iron gates. Rain fire upon them with catapults and disciplined archers. Hold the line until dawn \u2014 no matter the cost.\nTRAIN AN UNSTOPPABLE ARMY\nForge sturdy weapons and armor to ready your warriors for the siege. Advance from simple infantry to powerful siege engines \u2014 mount ballistas and trebuchets atop your towers. Archers, swordsmen, and pikemen will fight to their last breath if trained and equipped well.

Choose your keep\u2019s location wisely \u2014 it can set you on the path to an unbreakable stronghold. But be aware, as seasons change, these allies can betray you.

To survive the winter, you\u2019ll need to stockpile enough supplies while the sun still shines.\nBUILD, DEFEND, EXPAND, REPEAT\nA thriving economy powers a stronger army. Expand your domain, claim new lands, and mine precious Sunstone to build and protect your people. But beware \u2014 stretch your borders too thin, and you\u2019ll leave your realm exposed.\nAs your settlement grows, you will push back the forces of the night. But will you have the strength to end the ancient war between the Sunfolk and the creatures of the Moon?",
