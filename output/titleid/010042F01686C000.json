Execute combat strategies, evade foes, and overcome the tomb\u2019s defenders to find the source of the curse placed upon the rest of the terracotta.\n\n\nSolve the Mystery of the Curse\n\nYou are one of eight thousand warriors bound to protect the Qin Emperor in his afterlife. Your comrades are not your enemies, even if they do not think so at the moment\u2026\n\n\nMaster your ability to channel the light of Yin, not only for switching realms but also for manipulating surroundings.\nAwaken ancient mechanisms and descend into the underworld, overcoming foes through speed and agility, instead of only using brute force.\nDefeat nine brutal bosses, requiring the mastery of the nine phases of Qi: The universal energy that forms all parts of living beings.\n\nWitness the Rise of China\n\n\nThe Qin dynasty laid the foundations of China that would endure two thousand years.
