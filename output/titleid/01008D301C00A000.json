There, he begins a new chapter as the eldest son of the illustrious Tohno family, finding that a life of luxury doesn't sit right with him. As the days pass, familiar sights of the past awaken fragmented memories. Then, one day, he passes by a monster in the shape of a human...\n\nThus begins the celebrated story of TSUKIHIME, first created in 1999 as an indie visual novel.
