	"description": "Released by Bothtec in 1985, EGGY is an action game that won the Excellence Award at the \"1st Bothtec Program Contest,\" depicting the battle between Earth and Gasp on Eggy. While an action title, it's not a frantic shooter; players control Ena to retrieve falling supplies. \n\nDue to quirky design\u2014weapons being ground-attack only, mandatory crouching before flight, and a unique floating movement\u2014avoiding enemy attacks is key. The 20-stage game is cleared when enough supplies drop. Novice players may prioritize survival (clearing without collecting), while experienced players can aim for a high score by collecting them.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
