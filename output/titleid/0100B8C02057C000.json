	"description": "This game, released in 1988 in Japan, is a simulation game. The player takes on the role of Prince Lancelot, who rises to reclaim Camelot Castle.\n\nThe game uses a strategy map to move troops, and when engaging enemy forces on the map, it switches to a real-time battle system where soldiers fight in real-time. Although it may initially seem like an RTS, each character has a defined personality, with injured characters choosing to leave the battlefield to rest, and archers trying to maintain distance from the enemy. Some units are stubborn and refuse to retreat, adding a layer of individuality to the battlefield. This personality system leads to diverse and dynamic combat scenarios. Additionally, characters can level up and become stronger through repeated battles, adding an element of character progression.\n\nThe game also features a narrative aspect, with scenarios where traveling across various battlefields and regions can increase allies and obtain new equipment. Occasionally, boss battles occur, offering dramatic and engaging adventures. This game successfully combines the best elements of simulation and RPG systems.\n\nAs the first title in the Gochakara series, it continues to be supported by retro game fans. It's a highly recommended title for players who enjoy both simulation and narrative-driven RPG elements.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
