But not for long!\n\nWhen\u00a0Grandparaffine sends Bulb Boy to venture into the eerie depths of the basement in a search of\u00a0a precious jar full of delicious jam, it quickly turns out that this mission will not be as easy as it might seem. And by saying that we don't mean problems such as a missing key to the doors.\u00a0We talk about\u00a0navigating through the dark, shadowy corners of the cellar...\n\nOh, and about facing  sticky jelly creatures and their spine-tingling boss that wants Bulb Boy's head for his own. Yeah.\u00a0\n\nBulb Boy 2: Jar of Despair is the sequel to the hit and award-winning indie game that combines point & click adventure with horror game. The original visual style of the game is inspired by 90\u2019s cartoons  and emphasizes the grotesqueness of the production, full of cute creatures and disgusting details, shown in close-ups. \n\nSolving tricky puzzles and facing jelly monsters will slowly unfold a twisted story full of unpredictable twists and turns. And all this accompanied by original music and mind-scratching sound effects!\n\n- The original visual style inspired by 90's cartoons\n- Lots of delicious jam and grotesque jelly monsters\n- Close-ups showing disgusting details\n- Full controller support\n- Game perfect for Halloween and not just then!\u00a0",
