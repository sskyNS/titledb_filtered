	"description": "\"VIDEO HUSTLER\" is a sports game released by KONAMI in 1981.\nThis game is a simplified version of pool (pocket billiards). You strike the white cue ball to roll it, hit six balls, and sink them into the pockets.\nThe game\u2019s most distinctive feature is that the score can vary greatly depending on the numbers on the balls and the different multipliers assigned to each pocket.\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.\n\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
