	"description": "Built from the ground up to be exciting for players of all skill levels, Jamestown+ is friendly to shoot 'em up newcomers while also offering the full-throttle challenge that die-hard fans of the genre crave.\n\nSet on 17th-century British colonial Mars, Jamestown+ is a neoclassical cooperative shoot-em-up for up to four players. Lush pixelart and an award-winning orchestral soundtrack immerse you in Raleigh\u2019s battle to protect Britain\u2019s last bastion: Jamestown colony. Jamestown+ features all the intensity, depth, and lovingly handcrafted pixels of a classic arcade shooter, with a modern twist: deeply-integrated cooperative gameplay.\n\nEight years in the making, this is the definitive expanded and remastered edition of the critically-acclaimed debut title from Final Form Games.\n\nFun for all:\n\n- Jamestown's wide array of difficulty levels gives newcomers an exciting way to get into the shoot 'em up genre while also offering experts the crisply-controlling intense action they crave.\n- Jamestown+ plays beautifully at any number of players - you'll only lose a credit when the whole team is destroyed at once, so you're always happy to have a bonus friend in on the action!",
