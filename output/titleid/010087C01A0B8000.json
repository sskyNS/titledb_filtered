	"description": "Our team has tried to develop the deadliest weapon. And we realized that there is nothing more deadly than the fastest fighter under the control of an experienced pilot. Become a real pilot and show what you are capable of. A bunch of opponents are not afraid of you if you are on a new high-speed fighter. Many missions with a theme (Shoot or be shot down) will keep you on your toes. Realistic graphics, excellent planes, maneuvering like real ones, turn the game into a real battle for survival. Become one of the pilots and soar in the air with full 360-degree freedom of movement. With knocking down your enemies you will experience all the thrill of the game.
