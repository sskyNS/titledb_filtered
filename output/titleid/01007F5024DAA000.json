	"description": "Step into a place where nothing feels quite right \u2014 a silent, twisting space that seems to breathe on its own. Every corner hides a whisper, every shadow watches, and something follows your every move.\n\nThis is a horror experience built on tension, mystery, and the uneasy feeling that you're never truly alone. The walls feel too close, the silence too loud, and the presence behind you far too real.\n\nYour only goal is simple, yet terrifying: keep moving, stay sharp, and don\u2019t let fear slow you down. Because in this place\u2026 hesitation is dangerous.\n\nRun fast. Think fast.\nAnd whatever you do \u2014 don\u2019t look back.",
