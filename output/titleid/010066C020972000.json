	"description": "In a world where honey production is key to survival, the queen bee has tasked you, the most creative and skilled worker bee, with maintaining and expanding the hive\u2019s honeycombs. But there\u2019s a twist each honeycomb is a complex hexagonal puzzle, and only by arranging the honeycomb cells in perfect alignment can the nectar flow smoothly.\n\nAs you rotate, flip, and split the honey-filled hexagonal cells, your mission is to clear pathways (lines) to store honey efficiently. The more honeycombs you align at once, the greater your rewards in the form of golden nectar.\n\nIn the Classic Mode, maintain the hive's structure at your own pace, carefully planning each move. But in Time Trial Mode, race against the clock to ensure enough honey is collected before the day ends. Watch out in Bomb Mode, where rogue honey-bombs threaten to destroy your careful work. And if you're up for a real challenge, the Advance Mode will test your ultimate puzzle-solving skills with complex honeycomb arrangements.\n\nWith daily rewards for consistent work and global competition among bees, can you become the top worker and rise to the top of the Nintendo Switch\u2122 global leaderboard?",
