	"description": "You are a simple sailor caught in a storm on your first voyage. The ship is wrecked on the reef, the whole crew is dead, and only you are thrown ashore on a deserted island. Do you have any other choice but to try to survive? Find out in the sequel to the visual novel card game \u201cChoice of Life: Wild Islands\u201d!  \n\nConquer the jungle and prove that even in the most desperate situation you are the master of your destiny!  \n\nIt's up to you whether you're a hard worker or a hedonist, taking everything nature has to offer. Do you want to build a civilization in the wild forest, all alone, or face death face to face while enjoying life?  \nDecide how to explore the island. Save your supplies or spend them recklessly. Fight the forest beasts in bloody battles or try to tame them and live in harmony. \n It's up to you! Leave the island or make it your new home!  \n\nBut be careful - every choice you make could cost you your life, and maybe not only your life...  \n\nKey Features:  \n\u2605 A non-linear story where every choice can have unpredictable consequences. Betray a friend in Act 1? Watch it haunt you 10 hours later.\n\u2605 300+ Branching Decisions: Steal a canoe, ally with pirates, or adopt a venomous pet parrot. Every action reshapes the story.\n\u2605 A thousand events and a bottle of rum! Or rather, a multiple ways to die....  \n",
