Against the backdrop of Victoria Harbor's breathtaking nighttime view, Krueger began to build a new criminal empire by joining forces with the Triad, Hong Kong's most powerful organization.\n\nFrom the narrow alleys of the Kowloon peninsula to the luxurious buildings of Central, the dangers of illegal arms, drugs, and human trafficking spread. The once-safe streets of Hong Kong now fell into a maelstrom of crime. With the Hong Kong Police helpless, the Crime Busters special unit was immediately dispatched to Hong Kong.\n\nThe Crime Busters gather intelligence in the bars of Lan Kwai Fong, pursue suspects in the bustling streets of Tsim Sha Tsui, and sometimes conduct operations while riding on Hong Kong's iconic Star Ferry. Amidst the complex terrain and cultural differences of an unfamiliar city, the Crime Busters battle the Triad and Krueger's forces, launching operations to save beautiful Hong Kong.",
