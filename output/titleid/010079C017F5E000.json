Experiment with different combinations to suit your playstyle.\n\nREWARDING PUZZLES\nSolve fiendish environmental puzzles, and decode the ingeniously designed Challenge Tombs to unlock bonus rewards.\n\n2-4 PLAYER LOCAL CO-OP\nTeam up with a friend \u2014 or two or three \u2014 to take down waves of enemies, tackle tombs and compete for treasure, artifacts, and bragging rights.",
