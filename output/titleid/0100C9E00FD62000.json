The End\u2026\nb\u2026but wait\u2026the game just started! \nIn this turn-based strategy game, you begin at the end of the story and have to go back in time to prevent war.

Think carefully to choose the right points to weaken and still survive. Can you manage with less health? Or do you prefer to deal less damage? You will have to make the right (tricky) decisions to anticipate your next fights. Thankfully your units offer a wide range of special abilities that can help you. \nMaster the art of leveling down and find out how it all began!\n\nFeatures:\n-    Campaign Mode: Play as Cendor, lord of Farabel. Go back in time to save the city in a campaign of 26 epic and challenging battles.\n-    Classic Mode: Purchase units and war machines and destroy your enemy as quickly as possible and with the least amount of casualties.
