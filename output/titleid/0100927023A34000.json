	"description": "SOMA is a horror and science fiction video game from Frictional Games, the creators of Amnesia: the Dark Descent. It is a haunting story about identity, consciousness and what it means to be human.\n\nThe radio doesn't work, food is scarce and machines have begun to believe they are people. The submerged PATHOS-II facility has suffered terrible isolation and difficult decisions will have to be made. What to do? What makes sense? What is left to fight for?\n\nEnter the world of SOMA and confront the horrors submerged in the depths of the ocean. Rummage through locked terminals and secret documents to uncover the truth behind the chaos. Search for the last inhabitants and take part in the events that will ultimately shape the fate of the station. But beware, danger lurks around every corner: corrupt humans, twisted creatures, mad robots and even an inscrutable and omnipresent A.I..\nYou'll need to figure out how to deal with each one. Just remember there's no turning back, either you defeat your enemies or get ready to run.",
