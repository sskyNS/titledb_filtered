	"description": "Released by Random House in 1985 in Japan, Riglas is a side-view RPG. Players take on the role of a young Osborne tribe boy named May, as he unravels the secrets of Beljuna.\n\nWhile the game system involves moving with directional buttons and attacking with the A button, making it seem like a standard action RPG at first glance, the importance of key items related to conversations and the scenario gives the game a strong adventure game flavor.\n\nNoteworthy features for its time include side-view graphics with a sense of depth, beautiful scrolling, a grand world setting, and NPCs who don't repeat the same dialogue\u2014earning the game high praise.\n\nThis title is a culmination of the creator's techniques. It's a must-play for retro RPG fans.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
