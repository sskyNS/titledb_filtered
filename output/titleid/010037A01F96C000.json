The flames of hell will feel frigid compared to the hot-blooded Garcia on his quest to get his girl back from the Lord of the Underworld.\n\n- A hot-blooded, hellishly twisted, feverishly filthy, love and hate filled road trip\nJoin the crass Garcia Hotspur and his boney buddy, Johnson, as they traverse the depths of the Underworld to steal back Garcia's kidnapped lover, Paula, from the clutches of Fleming, the Lord of the Underworld. Let the soul of rock 'n' roll run loose in the heart of the twisted hellscape that is the Underworld.\n\n- Make it through fiendishly funky dungeons with the powers of light and dark\nThe powers of light and dark pave your path forward.

Use your buddy Johnson to blast your way through the darkness of the Underworld.\n\n- New content unique to the remaster\n4 all new costumes: Get dressed to the nines and kick some demon tail in style.\nAfter your first playthrough, carry over your progress into new game plus and spend an eternity raising hell in the Underworld.\n\n- A cult classic born from the most creative minds in the industry\nA third-person shooter crafted by industry legends Goichi Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7, etc.) and Shinji Mikami (Resident Evil, God Hand, etc.)",
