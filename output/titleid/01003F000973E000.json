And the best way to prove you\u2019re right is with brute force.\n\nJon Lockhart walked through the prison gates a free man, after spending years imprisoned as the supposed murderer of an old friend. He returned once more to the city where it all started intent on figuring out who it was that framed him for the murder and make them pay in blood for the crime. It'd take some work with the key witness dead, but that just meant he'd have to flush out every rat from hiding.\n\nOld friends and new enemies. Search for the truth, for loyalty and sanity - but all you can find here is redemption, betrayal and death. \nWelcome to Metropolis.\n\n\u2022 Beautiful comic art\n\u2022 Gorgeous, sexy girls\n\u2022 12 mental disorders and bad habits to unlock\n\u2022 Amazing soundtrack and audio effects\n\u2022 Rich and dramatic story, professionally voice acted\n\u2022 An addicting match-3 puzzle battle system with upgradable traits\n\u2022 Obscenity and sexism\n\u2022 4 different endings",
