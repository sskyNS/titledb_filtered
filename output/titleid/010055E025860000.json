	"intro": "Splash and smash your friends in this juicy party kart racing game! Make and take speedy shortcuts as you compete against the sweetest competition.",
	"description": "COUCH MULTIPLAYER CRAZINESS\n\nUp to 4 players can compete in spit-screen action. Party scoring means nobody is ever out of the game. Random tracks are picked until a player reaches 15 points. That means each round of fun can be from under ten minutes to as long as it takes to crown a winner!\n\nMAKE AND TAKE YOUR OWN SHORTCUTS\n\nPower-up items are all about juice. Leave a trail of your color while cutting across rough terrain, then drive on it again next lap. Or leave yourself bouncy fruit bumps to jump over walls and obstacles. Just watch out, you may reveal your secret early and allow other players to take it for themselves! Other players' juice will slow you down.\n\nTIGHT CONTROLS AND HANDLING\n\nFamiliar, responsive controls work for all racing styles, whether you're a drift wizard or a safe driver. Quick acceleration and short spinouts mean you'll always be in control and part of the action.\n\n16 TRACKS AND COUNTING\n\nThere are 16 unique tracks with tight corners, hills and valleys, and lots of boosts. Each has multiple hidden shortcuts ready to be found and used for the win!",
