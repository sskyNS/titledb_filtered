	"description": "In the latest installment of the Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire series, 5 new female companions will challenge you to a classic game of tile-matching. Select pairs of tiles to make them disappear, but be careful to stay ahead of the clock! Plan your moves strategically so you don\u2019t hit a dead end. For every third round you clear, you\u2019ll unlock new outfits for your lovely companions, all of which can be viewed in the alluring Dressing Room mode.\n\nEach time you play, tiles are shuffled to keep every session fun and unpredictable. For a more casual experience, switch to Easy mode to disable the clock and take advantage of hints and shuffle assists. With more than 60 layouts and randomized patterns, there\u2019s always a reason to come back for more tile-matching and quality time with these Pretty Girls!\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Match tiles and beat the clock to clear each round.\n\u2022 Reveal new costumes as you progress!\n\u2022 Meet 5 girls, all voiced in Japanese.\n\u2022 View unlocked characters and outfits.\n\u2022 Enjoy unlimited replay value with more than 60 tile patterns!\n",
