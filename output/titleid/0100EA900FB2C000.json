	"description": "Help Thomas the Allergic Mailman gather all his lost letters in this challenging and unique 2D platformer! In Hayfever, the player takes control of Thomas \u2013 a young postman with a strong work ethic. There is just one tiny little issue\u2026 Thomas suffers from terrible (and we mean TERRIBLE) allergies.\n\nIt is up to the player to use Thomas\u2019s allergies to help him traverse a dangerous world, turning his weaknesses into strengths! Different allergens have different effects on Thomas \u2013 radically changing how he interacts with the world. Regular pollen allows him to build up a big sneeze to propel himself through the air. Smog, on the other hand, makes him swell up like a balloon. Peanuts\u2026 Well, peanuts are a WHOLE other story.\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022\u00a0 Quirky retro-inspired graphics\n\u2022\u00a0 Demanding, sneeze-driven mechanics\n\u2022\u00a0 Four worlds, spanning all four seasons\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 140 levels, with 240 letters to collect (legend has it that collecting enough letters unlocks extra, extremely challenging levels\u2026)\n\u2022\u00a0 Allergy-fueled gameplay ranging from pollen and smog to nuts!\n\u2022\u00a0 An A.M.A.Z.I.N.G soundtrack\n",
