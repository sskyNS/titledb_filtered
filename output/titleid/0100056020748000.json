	"description": "Draw a path to where you want your cube to go. Take care to draw by anticipating what may happen after simulating the path you have drawn. Remember, your rights to draw a path is limited. Make good use of these rights!\n\n\t\u2022\tGet the Colored Cubes to Their Places\nUse the black cube whose route you have determined to reach the colored cubes to the units of their own color and solve the puzzles!\n\n\t\u2022\tAvoid the Red Lasers\nThe red lasers destroy both the black cube and the other colored cubes when touched. Put obstacles in front of them or walk around them to avoid them!\n\n\t\u2022\tGet the Purple Lasers to the Targets\nGet the purple lasers to the targets which they need to reach by reflecting them or pushing the obstacles in front of them.\n\n\t\u2022\tDifferent Ways to Solve Puzzles!\nYou can solve every puzzle in different ways as long as you don't exceed the route drawing rights given to you.\n",
