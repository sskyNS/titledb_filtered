	"description": "Governments and institutions manipulated by very powerful men, who created perverse constructions for their service under the pseudonym black butterfly.\n\nOne of these terrifying secret buildings was the S-313 prison, created in 1968 in an inhospitable area unknown to humanity.\n\nPoliticians, spies, inventors and anyone else who could possibly harm those who live in the shadows and control\u00a0the world, were imprisoned while others were led to believe that\u00a0they had simply disappeared.\n\nThey were flooded with darkness and confusion, being subjected to all kinds of barbaric acts.\n\nMany prisoners and non-prisoners died and their souls became trapped within the prison\u2019s walls.\n\nNow it\u2019s a ghost prison, where everything that happened stays in the past.\n\nFreeing these hate-filled\u00a0souls will be our irresponsible and difficult mission. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2022 Play by\u00a0conspiring against governments and secret institutions.\n\n\u2022 Either participate or don\u2019t! In certain areas of the game, you'll\u00a0find small tests that you can take. If you pass them, you win a reward. The decision to accept the challenge or not depends solely on you!\n\n\u2022 In the virtual store, you can get or buy all of the many weapons with specific uses for each adverse situation. There are two types: consumables and others that come\u00a0loaded and never run out.\n\n\u2022 Replayability with various challenges to overcome.\n\n\u2022 Big, difficult-to-defeat bosses.\n\n\u2022 Dark, desolate and extremely hostile environments.\n\n\u2022 A style of Metroidvania gameplay and a roguelike philosophy.\n\n\u2022 Get the infinite jet pack and experience new sensations.\n\n\u2022 As a roguelike game, you have two options when starting a new game, you choose:\n  \u2022 With a new seed you will have a different generation of the game.\n  \u2022 With the same seed, you will have an identical game situation.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t miss out on this adventure as it will continue on with future chapters in new conspiracies.",
