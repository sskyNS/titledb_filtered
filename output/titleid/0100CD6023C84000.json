	"intro": "Thousands of enemies. One survivor. Fight like a demigod, build deadly defenses, and grow stronger after every run in this fast-paced bullet hell set in mythic Greece.",
	"description": "Every run writes your legend.\n\nAchilles: Survivor is a fast-paced, single-player bullet hell set in Ancient Greece. Play as Achilles - or one of the legendary souls freed from Tartarus - and face relentless waves of enemies. Build deadly structures, evolve your powers, and grow stronger with every run. Defeat your enemies... or die trying.\n\nAre you ready for battle?\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- Fast-paced bullet hell in a world of Greek myths. Survive endless waves of enemies in a top-down action roguelike. \n- Build to survive, not just shoot. Drop traps, healing shrines, and summon allies with a unique structure-building system that turns the tide when things get desperate.\n- Unlock legendary survivors. Play as Achilles or one of a growing cast of mythological heroes, each with unique powers and playstyles.\n- Progression that respects your time. Complete challenges, earn Favors, and unlock permanent upgrades - get stronger with every attempt, even in defeat.\n- Return to mythic Greece. Explore beautifully crafted arenas inspired by Achilles: Legends Untold - from the walls of Troy to windswept Greek coastlines.\n\nDEFEAT YOUR ENEMIES... OR DIE TRYING\nAchilles has never faced monsters like this - and now it\u2019s your turn. Dive into chaotic, action-packed runs and hold your ground against relentless waves of enemies. Pick from dozens of powers and transform them mid-run in the Forge.\n\nThe deeper you go, the tougher it gets. No two runs are the same - and surviving means adapting fast.\n\nBUILD LIKE A STRATEGOS\nDrop flame turrets, raise healing shrines, or summon Myrmidons to fight at your side. Unlike other survivor-likes, your best weapon might be the map itself. Structures aren\u2019t just defenses - they're tactical tools for crowd control, sustain, and damage that can turn the tide of battle.\n\nBut remember - your resources are limited.\nBuild smart, and you\u2019ll live longer.\n\nWIELD THE MIGHT OF LEGENDARY HEROES\nAchilles made a bit of a mess escaping Tartarus. Now the world\u2019s crawling with souls that shouldn\u2019t be here - and you're one of them.\n\nUnlock and master a growing roster of heroes, each with a unique playstyle and signature power. From Achilles' raw melee strength to Paris' precise shots, Pythia\u2019s devastating magic, or Brontes\u2019 brute force - these are just a few of the heroes you can discover in the game.\n\nSURVIVE THE TRIALS OF THE OVERLORDS\nEvery region throws new horrors at you - venomous beasts, relentless ranged attackers, and bosses that won\u2019t give you a second chance. Learn their patterns, adapt your build, and survive escalating waves until it\u2019s time to face an Overlord.\n\nThese bosses don\u2019t wait for you to get ready - they\u2019ll punish weak strategies and reward smart structure placement.\n\nGET STRONGER WITH EVERY RUN\nDeath isn\u2019t failure - it\u2019s part of your path. Complete challenges to unlock new characters, earn treasures and Favors, and improve your stats with long-term upgrades.\n\nThe further you push, the more power you bring into your next run.\n\nEXPLORE ANCIENT GREECE\nReturn to the world of Achilles: Legends Untold and slay them all!\n\nBattle across mythical arenas drawn from Greek legend, such as Troy and the sun-scorched coasts of Greece. Each map features unique objectives, building zones, and mythological threats waiting to be conquered.\n\nSpecial thanks\u2026 to YOU\nWe\u2019re a small team making the kind of games we love to play - and they wouldn\u2019t be the same without your feedback.\n\nWe're adding new content, improving systems, and optimizing performance with every update.
