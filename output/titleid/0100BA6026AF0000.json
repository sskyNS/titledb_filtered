	"description": "Get ready for intergalactic barking and clever strategy in Collie Call: The Future Is Calling. Here, you control a robotic dog in outer space on a very unusual mission: organize floating sheep into air-bubble pastures before chaos takes over the galaxy.\n\nEach stage is a smart puzzle where every push matters. Teleporters flash, buttons activate futuristic gates, and every move can mean the difference between a perfect solution or a sheep stuck in the wrong corner of the universe. Plan carefully, test routes, use undo without fear, and refine your strategy until everything clicks into place.\n\nWith 30 levels full of progressive challenges, charming sci-fi visuals, and accessible mechanics, Collie Call blends logic, cuteness, and technology into an engaging experience. It is the perfect puzzle for players who enjoy thinking calmly, experimenting with creative solutions, and celebrating that satisfying feeling of getting everything just right.\n\nThe future is calling. And it needs a good dog.",
