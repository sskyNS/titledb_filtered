	"description": "FIGHT FOR YOUR FREEDOM\nIn the future, even death can\u2019t free you. If a criminal dies while serving their sentence, they are reconstructed to return to their suffering. And you\u2019re serving a 1300-year sentence. The only way to shorten this sentence? Win on \u201cThe Last Ticket.\u201d The rules are simple: there is a shuttle on the roof of the prison, and if you can fight your way through hordes of other inmates and reach it in time, you will be given your freedom.\n\nNO COMPROMISES\nKIBORG is a hybrid of old-school beat\u2019em ups, shooters, and rogue-likes. The fights are fast, brutal, and deadly. Sever limbs, squash heads, and tear cybernetic cores apart from living foes. There are dozens of enemy types with unique abilities and tactics, and they are mixed and matched to create hundreds of challenging encounters. If you\u2019re here for blood and gore, you\u2019ve come to the right place.\n\nIMMENSE BUILD VARIETY\nReplace your body parts with an array of cybernetic implants, enabling a wide variety of playstyles. Experiment with hundreds of power-enhancing augmentations and apply dozens of mutations to create deadly synergies. Wield a variety of melee weapons and firearms of all types. Use combos and special attacks to devastate your foes. Unleash millions of possible combinations and countless potential viable builds to destroy those standing between you and freedom.",
