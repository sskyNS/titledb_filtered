	"description": "Skinwalker is a horror adventure escape game that takes place in a frozen wilderness where every second counts. Trapped alone in a dark, merciless forest, your only lifeline is the fire that keeps you warm against the bitter cold. However, the freezing night isn't your only enemy. A terrifying creature known as the Skinwalker lurks nearby, hiding among the wildlife and waiting for you to let your guard down.\n\nTo survive, you\u2019ll need to scavenge for resources and think quickly in high-pressure situations. You'll need to collect sticks to feed your fire, search for wooden planks to cross crumbling bridges, and uncover hidden tools, such as shovels and keys, that could mean the difference between life and death. Each step away from the fire is a gamble as the icy air closes in and the Skinwalker waits in the shadows, ready to attack.\n\nThe forest is full of danger at every turn, testing your wits, instincts, and courage. Manage your time, keep your fire alive, and stay one step ahead of the horror stalking you. Survival is possible, but only if you can outlast the cold and the creature that wears many faces.\n\nThis is not for the faint of heart. In Skinwalker, fear is as cold as the forest itself.",
