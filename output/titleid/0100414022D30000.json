	"description": "Fight against scorpions, bats, and mummies while searching for the diamond among three treasures to warp to the next stage! What awaits at stage 16!? \n\nThis action game was released in 1983 in Japan. Players control an adventurer exploring a pyramid in search of treasure. Each room is patrolled by scorpions and bats, so use the passageways wisely, take advantage of paired warp tunnels, or hide in treasure chests to avoid them. If the adventurer comes into contact with an enemy, they will lose a life, and when all lives are lost, it's game over.\n\nEach room contains three treasure chests, which may hold a gun to be used as a weapon, an invincible and hostile mummy, or a diamond that opens a warp tunnel to the next stage. Find the diamond as quickly as possible and advance to the next stage.\n\nAdditionally, each room has a limited amount of air, which depletes over time. As the air level decreases, enemies move faster, and once it reaches zero, the adventurer loses a life. Acting swiftly is the key to success.\n\nReleased in the same year as the MSX's launch, this game offers fast-paced gameplay that feels great and has an oddly addictive quality, making players want to keep coming back for more.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
