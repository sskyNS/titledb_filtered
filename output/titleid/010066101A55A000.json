	"description": "Two young friends, lost in a frightening world not made for children. If they cannot find a way out of this Nowhere place, they\u2019ll be condemned to a fate worse than death.\n\nFACE YOUR CHILDHOOD FEARS TOGETHER\n\nYou play as Low and Alone, best friends ever since they found each other in this lonely nightmare. They each possess their own iconic item: a bow for Low and a wrench for Alone. Working together, they\u2019ve become adept at sneaking through hidden passages, hoisting each other over massive obstacles, and watching each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWhether you\u2019re playing with a friend or an A.I. companion, you\u2019ll depend on each other's iconic items to create opportunities and to progress. The environment is full of clues and possibilities for imaginative children to exploit. Low\u2019s arrows can reach high targets, cut through ropes, or down flying enemies, and Alone\u2019s wrench is just the thing for crushing stunned enemies, smashing through barriers, or manipulating the workings of massive machines.\n\nEMBARK ON AN IMMERSIVE AND DISTURBING ADVENTURE\n\nNo matter where you go, the Nowhere is home to horrific monsters. These Residents won't hesitate to go out of their way to capture any intrusive little Visitors that draw their attention. You might find yourself playing a terrifying game of hide and seek with Monster Baby in the sandy ruins of the Necropolis, struggling to avoid swarms of voracious Candy Weevils in an unsettling Candy Factory, or dodging heavy feet while running along the rain-soaked promenade of a filthy funfair.\n\nYou'll need to be ready to run, hide, or even defend yourself at a moment's notice to stay in one piece.\n\nSINK INTO THE SPIRAL\n\nDon\u2019t be too distracted by the desolate beauty of the Nowhere. There are dark mysteries waiting for you as Low and Alone follow their mirror path across the Spiral. As each new location will become more dangerous and disturbing than the last, traumatic flashes from the past will begin to emerge. Will Low and Alone finally escape from this unending nightmare? Only you can help them, little ones...",
