	"description": "Zombie Royale.io throws you headfirst into a chaotic undead uprising where survival depends on sharp reflexes, quick upgrades, and relentless firepower.\n\nStart as a lone survivor with nothing but a pistol and big zombie problems. Blast your way through endless waves of the undead, collect cash, and use it to unlock better weapons, faster fire rates, and beefier allies. The more you upgrade, the longer you'll last\u2014and the bigger the horde gets.\n\nThe action ramps up fast, with increasingly tough levels that keep you dodging, shooting, and scrambling for loot. Whether you're mowing down zombies with a flamethrower or sprinting to the next supply drop, every second is packed with adrenaline.\n\nThink you\u2019ve got the reflexes to survive the apocalypse? Grab your weapon and join the carnage. And remember\u2014zombies don\u2019t take breaks, and neither should you.",
