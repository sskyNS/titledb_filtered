	"description": "\"SUPER COBRA\" is a shooting game released by KONAMI in 1981.\nThe player's goal is to fly their helicopter all the way to the enemy base that appears at the end and claim the spoils of war.\nBe careful not just of enemies as you progress through the game, but also of your fuel level, or you might crash and burn.\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",
