	"description": "GAMEPLAY\n\u2022 Explore a massive world with unique islands and landscapes. Discuss rumors and discover the origins of each island by talking to the people that live there.\n\u2022 Expect the unexpected when at sea. Events you may be unprepared for may occur such as a foodborne illness among your crew. You'll need to have access to the right supplies and have the experience to keep your ship afloat.\n\u2022 A casual but real challenge - While simple to pickup and understand, there are numerous events that only an experienced swashbuckler will be prepared for. This makes the game more satisfying for long term pirates.\n\u2022 Thoughtfully executed cutscenes that help to bring the world to life as well as reward pirates that explore.\n\nMORE FEATURES\n\u2022 Sailing between islands is necessary to expand your control over the world and to increase your reputation.\n\u2022 Tending to the morale, hunger, and thirst of your crew will require you to maintain a supply of food/water and consider whether or not rationing food is required during long journeys.\n\u2022 Governing islands you've conquered is a difficult responsibility as you will need to solve economic issues before they get out of hand.\n\u2022 Purchase larger ships as you fight your way through the sea. Famously powerful vessels such as the Galleon and Man of War are but a few of the available ships.",
