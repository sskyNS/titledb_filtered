	"description": "A NEW TWIST TO THE SIDE-SCROLLING NINJA GAIDEN SERIES EXPERIENCE\n\nFrom the acclaimed team behind Blasphemous, NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound successfully unites the classic lore and gameplay of the Tecmo-developed (now KOEI TECMO GAMES) NINJA GAIDEN series from the classic era with the depth and intensity of the modern 3D entries. The best of both eras come together to create an epic and thrilling adventure.\n\n\nDIVE INTO AN UNTOLD CHAPTER OF THE NINJA GAIDEN SAGA\n\nOur story begins when Ryu Hayabusa journeys to America to honor his father's will. While he is away, the barrier between the human and the demon worlds suddenly shatters, unleashing a terrifying army upon the Hayabusa Village, which now faces an unprecedented threat in Ryu's absence.\n\nTo stand against this new threat, Kenji Mozu, a young ninja from the Hayabusa Village, rises to the challenge! Trained by Ryu, he fights fiercely but soon finds himself in desperate straits. Forced to tap into forbidden power, Kenji sets aside centuries of animosity and forms an alliance with the sinister Black Spider Clan, convinced that combining their souls and skills is the only way to protect the world out of the Demon Lord's grasp!\n\n\nOLD SCHOOL GAMEPLAY WITH A BRAND-NEW POLISH\n\nCombining old-school feeling with modern precision, NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound retains the pick-up-and-play action of the classic titles, while introducing new layers of depth.\n\nAlongside the new protagonist, Kenji Mozu, is the skilled assassin Kumori. Take control of these two powerful ninjas simultaneously and unravel their interconnected stories.\n\nUse the Ninja Fusion to unleash devastating abilities and obliterate your enemies. NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound features impeccable mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to truly master, challenging the skills of even the most seasoned fans of the NINJA GAIDEN series!\n\n\nA SPECTACULAR PIXEL ART SHOWDOWN\n\nStep into a reimagined version of the classic NINJA GAIDEN universe, brought to life through stunning, meticulously crafted visuals. Every enemy is recreated with a level of detail that was once impossible.\n\nThe brutal, nostalgia-filled aesthetic of NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound pays homage to the past while pushing the boundaries of modern pixel art, making every battle a feast for the eyes.\n\n\nDo you have what it takes to become a true ninja master?",
