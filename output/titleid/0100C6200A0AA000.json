	"description": "A year has passed since the events of Maple Creek. But for the past few months, our detective has been hot on the trail of the demonic preacher she fought one year ago. Yet he has managed to always stay one step ahead. \n\nShe hoped to bring an end to the chase in the redwood forests of Northern California. But like so many times before, the trail went cold\u2026 \n\nThen she encountered an abandoned camper in the middle of the highway. Enormous claw marks scored the roof and the lost family\u2019s personal belongings were scattered everywhere. All signs pointed to the scene being fresh. \nAnd all clues led into nearby Ravenwood Park...\n\nWalking through the park gates, the detective feels the weight of invisible eyes watching. Sinister shadows lurk behind the park\u2019s enchanting scenery and the wary glances of its overly-polite employees. Is this place connected to Maple Creek, and the preacher? \n\nWho is the mysterious prisoner she meets on the forest path \u2013 someone stalking her every move, or a possible ally? Is she merely a puppet being used in forces from outside our world, or will she finally resolve the evil events that began one year before?",
