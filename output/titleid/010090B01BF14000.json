	"description": "Help giant Luna and Jonah the boy to rescue the planet's Creatures together in a synchronized action game!\nThe Great Tsunami prophesied by GE III is coming, and only seven days remain to save the world! Rescue as many Creatures you can before it's too late!\n\n\n[Kemonon and Plan-Plan Creatures]\nThe world is inhabited by Creatures called Kemonon and Plan-Plan. When Jonah plays the tambourine, they feel safe and approach! You might even find rare Kemonon and Plan-Plan hiding in various places. Save as many Kemonon and Plan-Plan as you can before the Great Tsunami hits!\n\n[How Do I Play?]\nTilt the left Joy-Con\u2122 to make Luna dip her fishing rod and sway Jonah from side to side. Press the \"\"A\"\" button rhythmically or shake the right Joy-Con to make Jonah play the tambourine. When the Creatures approach, gather them up and rescue them! Hold the \"\"L\"\" button to reel Jonah and the Creatures up while dodging the obstacles! Be careful not to hit the sides too hard. If you do, the Creatures get angry and let go. Also, watch out for falling objects and sudden gusts of wind. If you team up with a partner to keep Jonah safe, you'll surely do well!\n\n[Many Places to Visit]\nOnly seven days remain until the world ends. But if Luna and Jonah are together, they can rescue Creatures anywhere! Whether it's in a sea full of fish, or a snowy landscape, or a raging storm, there's always a chance of finding a rare Creature you've never seen before...\"\"\nSynchronized Action / High Score Challenges / Quick Thinking is Key!\n\nLUNA-3X\nTogether Beyond the World's End",
