	"description": "Two games based on those two bodacious dudes of movie fame? Excellent!!!\n\n- Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure - \n\nHistory has been all screwed up and only the San Dimas Duo can set things straight. Awesome responsibility, man. Ride the Power Phone Booth to six different worlds. Galactic, man. Search for famous Historical Dudes through space and time. Most Cosmic.\n\nTalk with the likes of Julius Caesar (he invented Caesar salad)  and Napolean (the short, dead dude). Send them back in time or you\u2019ll miss the Wyld Stallyns concert- starring you! Heavy. \n\nIts a bodacious, mind-boggling role-playing adventure. And your only chance to save the world and earn the respect you deserve. No way - yes way!\n\n- Bill & Ted's Excellent Portable Adventure - \n\nA world without our most excellent compatriots Bill and Ted? No way! Yes way - if the Grim Reaper and the evil Bill and Ted robots get their way! DeNomolos wants to totally change the future, and the only way to stop this most heinous dude is to travel though the \u201ccircuits of time\u201d and collect the stolen time fragments! 10 adventures - 50 quests.\n\nBut watch out! Historical dudes like Billy the Kid are tumblin\u2019 with killer tumbleweeds while the Executioner has an axe to grind with you. Napoleon has a \u201cshort\u201d temper and even Granny S. Preston Esquire tries to bag you. Most Bogus!\n\nTime is running out\u2026so be excellent to each other and party on dudes!",
