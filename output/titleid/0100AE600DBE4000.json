Journey from planet to planet, each procedurally generated with unique environments, challenges, and alien creatures. \n\nExplore \nScout out the richest resources and the deadliest critters, and discover unique challenges and powerful artifacts. \n\nExtract \nYou're going to need all the Ore and Crystal you can carry if you're going to mount a successful defense or purchase the upgrades you'll need to make it home alive. \n\nExcape \nErr... Escape. The resources on each planet won't last forever, but the alien creatures willing to bite your legs off never seem to end, eventually overwhelming even the most stalwart crew. Hold out as long as you can... but don't throw your resources - or the lives of your crew - away to a lost cause. Always be prepared to make a timely exit when things start getting hairy.",
