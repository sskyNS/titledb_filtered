	"description": "CATO: Buttered Cat is an adorable puzzle platformer, inspired by the buttered-cat paradox meme: Cats always land on their feet, and toast always lands buttered side down. By strapping a piece of buttered toast to a cat's back, you create a paradox that results in an infinitely spinning, floating butter-cat perpetual motion machine!\nThe game revolves around the two main characters, \"Cat\" and \"Buttered Toast.\" You'll need to use the interactions between them to solve various puzzles at each game level. The full game is featuring over 140 main levels and more than 60 side levels. There are also hidden rooms, challenging boss battles, and fun mini-games. The full version will include an outfit system, with 30+ Cat and Toast skins waiting for you to collect!\n\nCat and Toast Joint Adventure:\n\u30fbControl the cat as it runs left and right, climbs the cat scratching broad, and even slips through pipes. Hey! cats are liquid!\n\u30fbGuide the toast meanwhile with the cat, as toast jumps like projectiles. Hold down and power on, and the toast will jump farther!\n\u30fbWhen the two combine, they can trigger the paradox, taking the cat to unreachable places!\n\nWhimsical Contraptions:\nCATO will take you to a brain-teasing adventure, exploring five different worlds, each filled with unique contraptions.\nIncluding toaster(Toast: NO!!)to buttered trampolines and speed-boasting space pipes(Cat: Meow!!). Along the way, the two will also encounter some mysterious companions to help them with puzzles.\n\nBoss Fights & Mini-Games:\nThe game is about puzzles, with a little action elements. You don't need to perform difficult platforming for most of the time; just focus on solving the puzzles. However, some pesky enemies will be standing in your way during the adventure. Your abilities will help you defeat them.\nAs you progress through the adventure, you'll also unlock various mini-games. Once collected, these can be installed on the gaming console in your little hideout, allowing you to play them anytime.\n\nEaster eggs and More:\nIn the world of CATO: Buttered Cat, there are many hidden rooms that can only be accessed through secret passages. Here, you can find Easter eggs from other worlds and mysterious drop items.\nTake them back to your cozy little hideout, put on your favourite outfit, and set off again!\n\nWhat exactly is the cat and toast searching for? Pieces of these stories are scattered along the adventure, waiting for you to explore.",
