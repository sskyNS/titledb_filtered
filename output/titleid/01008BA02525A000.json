	"description": "Dispatch is a superhero workplace comedy set in modern day Los Angeles from the writers and directors of Tales from the Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us, and features an all-star cast including Aaron Paul, Laura Bailey, and Jeffrey Wright.\n\nYou play as Robert Robertson, AKA Mecha Man, whose mech-suit is destroyed in a battle against his nemesis, forcing him to take a job at a superhero dispatch center: not as a hero, but a dispatcher.\n\nAs their dispatcher, you take charge of a team of ex-supervillains given a shot at redemption. Manage and level up your roster, all while navigating office relationships and romances, and rebuilding your suit for a shot at revenge!\n\n> Shape the Story\n\nIn Dispatch, every decision you make influences the unfolding narrative. From banter in the breakroom to life-or-death situations in the field, your choices affect your relationships with the heroes, their allegiances, and the path your own story takes.\n\n>  Deploy Your Heroes \n\nUse the strategy map to review ongoing emergencies and deploy the right (or wrong) heroes to deal with them. Balance the risks and rewards as you make tactical decisions, knowing that each choice can have lasting consequences for your team and the city.\n\n> Manage Your Roster\n\nManaging heroes sometimes goes beyond their powers. Each hero comes with quirks, flaws, and baggage you\u2019ll need to navigate to keep the team together. Upgrade their skills and unlock abilities to boost their effectiveness in the field.\n\nBlending narrative, strategy, and humor, Dispatch explores what it means to be a hero, whether you're wearing a cape or behind a desk.\n\nFeaturing an all-star cast from every corner of entertainment:\n\nAaron Paul (Breaking Bad, Westworld, Black Mirror)\nLaura Bailey (The Legend of Vox Machina, The Last of Us II, Marvel's Spider-Man)\nErin Yvette (Hades II, The Wolf Among Us, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon)\nMoistCr1TiKaL (Charles White) \nJacksepticeye (Sonic Prime, River City Girls 1 & 2, Bendy and the Ink Machine)\nTravis Willingham (The Legend of Vox Machina, Critical Role, Lego Avengers)\nAlanah Pearce (V/H/S Beyond, Cyberpunk 2077, Gears 5)\nLance Cantstopolis (Karate, Dancing, Actor)\nJoel Haver (Filmmaker, Actor, YouTuber)\nTHOT SQUAD (Musician: Pound Cake, Hoes Depressed)\nYung Gravy (Musician: Betty (Get Money), oops!)\nMatthew Mercer (Critical Role, Overwatch, Resident Evil 6)\nand Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction, The Batman, Casino Royale)",
