	"description": "Ink and blood stain the streets of Ramezia. Witches must burn and sins must be judged. Venture forth as Sister Semilla to burn down the pillars of heresy in Minoria, an action-platformer by the creators of Momodora.\n\nThe story takes place during the fourth Witch War. It is a time of fanatical religious fervor. The Sacred Office, a powerful organization leading an Inquisition against heresy, purges the sinners who threaten humanity. Those responsible for conducting a mysterious ceremony that contradicts the rules of the Church are labeled \u201cwitches.\u201d Now, Sisters Semilla and Fran, missionaries in the Church\u2019s service, set out to thwart the witches\u2019 ceremony and protect the common-folk from heresy that endangers the status quo.\n\nMinoria is the latest and most ambitious game from Bombservice and a spiritual sequel to the Momodora series. Fans of Momodora will find familiar aspects in the design and gameplay elements, as they master the ins-and-outs of parries, dodges, and a variety of different spells. Now in HD format, with aesthetics mixing 2D hand-painted backgrounds and cel-shaded characters, Minoria continues Bombservice\u2019s legacy on consoles.\n\n\u30fbA powerful fantasy story inspired by the history of medieval Europe\n\n\u30fbA unique visual aesthetic combining hand-painted 2D art with cel-shading\n\n\u30fbFluid controls encouraging careful engagement and patient play\n\n\u30fbCombat enabling players to crush enemies with a mix of swordplay and spells\n\n\u30fbDefensive options including dodge-rolls and parries\n\n\u30fbA leveling system that helps players adjust to their desired difficulty\n",
