	"description": "Stephanie is ready to sacrifice everything for her dreams. She skips classes, ignores her mother, and becomes increasingly distant from her boyfriend, Brandon. All in order to prove that her photographs are art. However, the university does not think so, because shooting a \u201cselling shot\u201d is much more important than realizing the creative self. Stephanie is already at a boiling point when Brandon decides to leave... A deeply personal story about love, living with a mental illness and fighting to be heard.\n\nFeatures:\n- 10 chapters\n- Art Gallery\n- Dress-up minigame",
