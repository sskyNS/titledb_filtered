	"description": "When the sun gave up on humanity, darkness and gloom took its place.\n\nIn a world plunged into eternal night and torn by conflict between the living and the undead, one faint glimmer of hope still flickers in the hearts of two special souls. Gloomy Eyes tells the tale of Gloomy, a sweet zombie boy, and Nena, a mischievous human girl, who defy the rules by teaming up and embarking on a quest to bring back the daylight.\n\nA \u201cSelf-Coop\u201d Adventure\nControl both Gloomy and Nena in a completely single-player experience, switching between characters to solve brain-teasing environmental puzzles. Each character brings their own set of abilities, and you'll need the skills and quirks of both to progress through this delightfully wretched darkness.\n\nCreepy Cozy Horror\nStep into a world where the macabre meets the magical. Inspired by the art style of Tim Burton, Gloomy Eyes offers a lovingly crafted universe brimming with spooky charm, eerie beauty, and heartwarming gloom. No gore or jump scares to test your nerves, just a whimsical haunting atmosphere that will pull at your undead heartstrings.\n\nA Tale of Forbidden Companionship\nGather round for a heartwarmingly bleak fairy tale of necromantic adventure, as told by the old gravekeeper. While the living and the undead are squabbling something fierce, two unlikely souls meet and become one another's closest companions. But for any hope of a cheery forever after, they must set off on a journey together to find the sun and restore its light to the world.\n\nExplore Twisted Little Dioramas\nEach level is a stunning, handcrafted rotatable diorama, overflowing with visual macabre charm and ghoulishly delightful details. Explore these miniature worlds from multiple angles as you uncover secrets, solve puzzles, and play out a story of a love that should never be.",
