	"description": "This is an action RPG released in Japan by Nihon Falcom in 1995 and is a renewed version of Brandish (1991). The player takes on the role of the bounty head Ares, fighting various enemies, overcoming jumps and traps, and aiming to escape from the underground labyrinth.\n\nThe game\u2019s screen layout appears orthodox, but it uses a head-up view similar to car navigation, where the character always moves toward the top, and turning changes the orientation of the terrain. This rotating map allows players to view the terrain from multiple angles, but it also means that switches are sometimes placed in blind spots. If you get stuck, try rotating the map; you might discover an unexpected way forward.\n\nCompared to the original version, this remake features enhanced sound, changes to the BGM, more visibility of pitfalls, and adjustments for monsters recovering health\u2014making this Brandish even more enjoyable.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
