	"description": "Step into the Spiral with the Free Trial & Friend\u2019s Pass of Little Nightmares III. \n\nThis special offer lets you experience the beginning of the adventure at no cost - solo or with a friend in online co-op on the same platform. It also allows you to play the full adventure for free in online co-op if your partner owns a copy of the game on the same platform as yours.\n\n- One or two players can experience the beginning of Little Nightmares III for free, even without owning the game. Each player simply needs to download the Free Trial & Friend\u2019s Pass. If they choose to play together, both must be on the same platform and invite each other online. Should one player purchase the full game, progress made during the Free Trial will carry over, allowing both to continue seamlessly. With one unlocked copy, the entire campaign can be completed in online co-op on the same platform.\n\n- The Free Trial & Friend\u2019s Pass also lets you play the full game together online on the same platform: one player owns the full version, while the other just needs to download the Free Trial & Friend\u2019s Pass to join.\n\n\nTake on the roles of Low and Alone, two best friends trapped in the eerie lands of the Spiral. Work side by side to solve puzzles, survive terrifying encounters, and uncover the secrets hidden in the shadows.\n\nTry it today, invite a friend, and discover how far you can go together.",
