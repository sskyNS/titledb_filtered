	"description": "Wake up in the darkness of a cold, unfamiliar cellar, with the distant echo of footsteps that shouldn't be there. \nSanguis Luna throws you into a living nightmare, where every shadow hides a secret and every sound fills you with growing terror. \n\nYou are alone, with no memory of how you ended up in that cursed house, but one thing is certain: someone, or something, is watching you.\n\nThe walls of this ancient dwelling whisper stories of blood and pain, but every time you think you've found a way out, a familiar sensation chills your veins: an unsettling d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that keeps dragging you back. \nThe more you try to understand the nature of this dark presence, the more the line between reality and madness dissolves, pulling you into a vortex of fear and despair.\n\nThe tension is palpable, the darkness is your enemy, and time is a luxury you can't afford. \nEvery corner could hide a clue to your salvation... or a horror ready to consume you. Your only hope? Find a way out before the darkness closes in on you forever.",
