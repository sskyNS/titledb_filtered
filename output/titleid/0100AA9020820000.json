	"description": "Potions: A Curious Tale is an adventure-crafting game where your wits are your greatest weapons and combat is not always the answer. Play as Luna, a young witch who overcomes obstacles with the potions she brews, as she gathers items from enchanted lands and conquers devious puzzles on her quest. \n\nGrowing up is hard, and it\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re a witch! Encounter fairy tale and folklore characters as you guide Luna on her quest to become a potions master. With her sharp-tongued familiar at her side, Luna learns important coming-of-age lessons: Respect is earned, advice can be deceiving, and adults aren't always right.\n\nUse your wits to strategize conflict resolution that goes beyond pure combat-- you\u2019ll have to think on your feet and act quickly to sidestep danger and trick, charm, and scare your opponents into dropping valuable resources. \n\nAs powerful as your potions are, you\u2019ll find yourself up against monsters that can shrug off your most powerful attacks. Manage your resources carefully and use the environment and even other monsters to defeat your enemies, or you may find yourself with an empty satchel when you need your elixirs the most.\n\nOn her path to potions mastery, Luna must gather rare ingredients even before she brews her first potion. While her grandmother and friends teach her basic skills and recipes, Luna must fill her vials through experimentation and discovery. \n\nExplore the deep crafting system as you discover new ingredients across 7 biomes to craft over 100 unique potions with different element combinations. \n\nSolve devious puzzles and mysteries with your wits and your arsenal of mystical potions. With a little help from your grandmother (a powerful witch in her own right) and Helios, your cat familiar, you\u2019ll overcome the challenges of these enchanted lands.",
