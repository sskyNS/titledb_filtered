	"description": "Welcome to Uncanny Valley \u2013 an unsettling story-driven survival horror where nothing is as it seems. Explore an isolated facility and solve its many mysteries, but be warned: the choices you make have meaningful consequences that will determine your fate. Play through multiple times to reveal all of Uncanny Valley\u2019s darkest secrets. \n\nYou play as Tom, a security guard working the night shift at an abandoned facility in the middle of nowhere. Already troubled by disturbing dreams, Tom\u2019s reality takes a terrifying twist as he explores the eerie offices and corridors of the facility and begins to uncover the shocking secrets hidden within its walls\u2026\n\nConsequence system\nRather than failure always being greeted by death, Uncanny Valley uses a consequence system which imposes lasting effects on the player. For example, a mistake may result in a broken arm, which in-turn presents problems when trying to use a weapon. This changing dynamic impacts story and gameplay, requires players to rethink their approach to certain situations, and ensures a chilling sense of ever-present uneasiness.\n\nKey Features:\n- A huge, creepy facility to explore\n- Ominous and oppressive atmosphere\n- Compelling story with rich characters\n- Multiple endings to discover\n- Consequences which impact story and gameplay",
