	"description": "Arcadia. A 70\u2019s retro-futuristic metropolis where all its citizens enjoy a life of luxury and comfort\u2026 unaware that they\u2019re being broadcast live 24/7! Arcadia is not an ordinary city, but the most watched reality show on the planet - where a drop in popularity ratings comes at the highest cost: death.\n\nFor an average man with an uninteresting life like Trevor Hills, this could mean serious trouble - but luckily Trevor is being helped by a mysterious voice who will guide him through American Arcadia's backstage to his freedom. But is this all real, or just another show gimmick to raise audience ratings?\n\nAmerican Arcadia combines two gameplay styles, a 2.5D platformer and a first-person puzzle game, to reveal a unique story in a thrilling single player experience.\n\nUncover the truth and escape with your life in American Arcadia! \n \nESCAPE FROM A 70'S TELEVISED UTOPIA\nThe gripping story will be presented as a documentary with interviews and police interrogations of the characters as you progress through the game.\n\nTWO EXPERIENCES, ONE GAME\nAmerican Arcadia gives you control over two characters in completely different environments and unique playstyles: A 2.5D action side-scroller including challenging platform action, breath-taking chases, stealth and puzzles. As well as a full 3D first-person game, with hacking, exploration, stealth elements, and more puzzles to solve.\n\nIMPRESSIVE VOICE CAST\nYuri Lowenthal (Spider-Man 1 & 2, Prince of Persia The Sands of Time, Call of the Sea), Krizia Bajos (Cyberpunk 2077, League of Legends) and Cissy Jones (Firewatch, Life is Strange, Call of the Sea), among others, breathe life into the characters in American Arcadia.",
