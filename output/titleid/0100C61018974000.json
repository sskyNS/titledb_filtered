	"description": "A cascade of words, color, shapes and sound flows around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers. If enemies penetrate your perimeter you need to zoom into close range combat and beat them back, adjusting to a completely different perspective in the blink of an eye. Welcome to Jeff Minter\u2019s Akka Arrh.\n\nThis modern take from the fine developers at Llamasoft combines the intrigue of an incredibly rare Atari arcade prototype with a unique creative vision that delivers a wave shooter that is insanely addictive. Akka Arrh drips with Minter\u2019s sense of humor, love of psychedelic color, and ability to create games that are a joy to play.\n\nKey Features:\n\nPure arcade bliss! You'll be thrown directly into the action where combos, high scores, and survival are your only goals.\n\nCreate massive chains of enemy explosions and rack up ammo for precision shots to keep a combo and your rings (or life force) protected. Lose them all, and it\u2019s game over.\n\nStart from the beginning of the 50 unique levels, or pick up where you left off to power through to the end.\n\nAccessibility! Sensitive to flashing lights or just not a fan? Not to worry, as there is an option to disable the more intense visual effects so that the experience can be enjoyed by a wider audience.",
