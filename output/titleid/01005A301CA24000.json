	"description": "Good thing super-sleuths Freddi Fish and Luther are on the case. Their plan: build a trap to capture and expose the phony ghost. To reach their goal the two friends need your child's help to find a few things-and the list of items changes every time they play. Kids will dive right in to direct this undersea mystery filled with old friends, new faces and a festive sing-along soundtrack.\n\n\u2022\tLike the real world, Freddi Fish's world changes every time you play.\n\u2022\tSearch through fascinating places like a submarine, a ship or Atlantis.\n\u2022\tOut of time? You can save the game and finish it later.\n\u2022\tTake breaks with Freddi Fish: play games like Crab Invaders, solve puzzles, draw pictures or just sing songs.",
