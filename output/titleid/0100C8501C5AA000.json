	"description": "Still Joking is:\n- A mix of visual novel, interactive fiction, and adventure\n- A world of reflections where everything is like on our side of the mirror but a little different\n- A story about characters with complex and unique relationship scales\n- A detective mystery where you know who but want to also know why\n\nWe have:\n- Multiple endings for main storylines and for each significant character\n- 12 to 15 hours of playthrough (1,000+ choices and 400,000 words)\n- Interactive elements (interactive points, QTEs, investigation mechanics)\n- A fully voiced cat :-)\n\nThe Story:\nReflections always do the exact same thing we do. They are forced to repeat all the morning routines, all the self-affirmations and funny faces, and sometimes even the death of their prototype.\n\nSo what happens after? How do they deal with it?\n\nPlay as Iris, a reflection of the famous actress murdered in front of the mirror. Torn away from usual life, you\u2019re at a turning point where decisions must be made, and they will shape you.\n\nEmbrace the sudden journey through the void accompanied by your inner voice and many other distinct characters.",
