	"intro": "Old-timers just keep saying that they don\u2019t do old-school action games anymore like they used to. Well, that\u2019s not totally true \u2014 Radioactive Dwarfs is an epic example of the fact that these games are still alive and kicking! Right from the box you\u2019ll get top-down retro-action with a thrilling story of mutated dwarfs that kidnap, kill and eat people. Our heroine has decided to stop the dwarf threat on her own. She\u2019ll venture deep down and below to find every dwarf and shoot it with her trusty gun. Grenades will come in handy as well. We can assure you that this game is a blast for every person who likes retro games, and always in a mood for some jokes with B-movie flavor.",
