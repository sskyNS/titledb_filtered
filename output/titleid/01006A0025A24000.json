	"description": "Freedom comes with four wheels and a full tank of gas. Start with a dusty old van and turn it into your dream home\u2014or flip it for profit and chase your next build. Whether you're in it for the thrill of renovation or the call of the open road, this game lets you live the nomadic dream, no GPS required.\n\nExplore a vibrant open world packed with hidden campsites, cozy lake views, and the occasional \u201cdid I take a wrong turn?\u201d mountain trail. From serene forests to rugged backroads, every trip is its own story.\n\nCustomize every inch of your ride, pick your parking spot, and let the weather spice things up\u2014from starry nights to soggy surprises. You can run a renovation empire, rent out vans to other wanderers, or just kick back by the fire and roast digital marshmallows.\n\nNo deadlines. No bosses. Just your van, your journey, and maybe a raccoon trying to steal your cooler.",
