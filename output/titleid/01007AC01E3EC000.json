	"description": "Dodge, roll, block incoming cats!\n\nUse power-ups to turn the scores. If you've always wanted to catch your friends with a giant laser pointer or shoot'em with a cheese cannon you can do it all! Just watch out for those flying yarn balls.\n\nPlay with up to 4 players (including bots) in 4 game modes.\n\nGrow your kitten collection and collect them all. Complete various tasks and secret challenges and you're reward will be... You guessed right, more kittens.\n\nMaster all the levels, so you won't lose one of your nine lives. If surviving the power-ups isn't tricky enough, you'll have to watch out for crazy traps too. Surely moving cars, blackouts and eagles aren't that bad.",
