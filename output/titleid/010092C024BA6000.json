	"intro": "Explore a haunted mansion, uncover a killer\u2019s madness, and enter surreal paintings in this chilling horror adventure.",
	"description": "Death Frame is a psychological horror experience where reality fractures with every step. You play as the estranged child of a notorious serial killer, returning to the mansion you\u2019ve inherited after years of silence. Within its rotting walls, you uncover paintings that pull you into fragmented memories and surreal dreamscapes\u2014each revealing a piece of your father's madness, his victims, and maybe\u2026 your own bloodstained legacy.\nAs you explore the decaying estate, you'll find three disturbing diaries: a cold list of victims, the terrified final words of a captive, and the spiraling thoughts of a mind consumed by madness. Each reveals a new layer of the truth.\nBut something still lingers in the house.\nSomething watching.\nWaiting.",
