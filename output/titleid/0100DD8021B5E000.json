Then auto-battle your way through them, harvesting as much Glimour as you can from the cursed residents before darkness overcomes your torch. \n\nEarn favours from the Harvest Maiden, find Relics to trade with the Hen Wife, Wulver and other characters from Scottish folk lore to upgrade and curate your deck, and hope you are strong enough to face The Warden when you can finally reach it. \n\nFeatures \n\u2022 Dynamic Deck and Dungeon Building: Create your dungeon as you play, using a variety of cards to place rooms, corridors, and more. Modify your deck by earning the Maiden\u2019s favour or interacting with characters within the ruins.\n\u2022 Strategic Room Synergies: Place rooms like campfires, libraries, and portals strategically to unlock powerful effects and adapt your approach to every challenge.\n\u2022 Endless Replayability: Each run offers a new dungeon layout, fresh challenges, and evolving strategies. Unlock rule-changing modifiers, discover hidden echoes, and expand your card pool with every victory.\n\u2022 Rooted in Scottish Folklore: Explore a world inspired by Celtic legends, from witches and faeries to the eerie Maiden and her connection to the Harvests, with the option to immerse yourself in the experience by playing in Scottish Gaelic.\n\u2022 Evolving Challenges: Confront new dangers with every attempt, from procedurally generated ruins to powerful enemies and artifacts that redefine your strategy.\n\u2022 Unlock Hidden Treasures: Discover rare charms, weapons, and lore fragments to shape your journey and uncover the secrets of the Restless Ruins.",
