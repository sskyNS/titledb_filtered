	"description": "Terra Nil is a game about transforming a barren, lifeless landscape into a thriving, vibrant ecosystem. Turn dead soil into fertile grassland, clean polluted oceans, plant sprawling forests, and create the ideal habitat for animals to call home. Then recycle your buildings and leave no trace that you were there. Reclaim the wasteland.\n\nA reverse city builder\nUse advanced eco-technology to purify the soil, creating plains, wetlands, beaches, rainforests, wildflowers, and more\u2014then efficiently recycle everything you've built, leaving the environment pristine for its new animal inhabitants.\n\nDifferent maps every time\nProcedurally generated landscapes mean no two playthroughs of Terra Nil will ever be the same. Plan your build around randomized, challenging, and unpredictable terrain, including snaking rivers, mountains, lowlands, and oceans.\n\nA natural ebb and flow\nEach region of Terra Nil progresses through phases, with the ultimate goal being leaving pristine wilderness behind. Levels are not about infinite growth, but rather balancing and nurturing the environment before leaving it in peace.\n\nExperience tranquility\nLush hand-painted environments, relaxing music, and an atmospheric ambient soundscape make Terra Nil a peaceful, meditative experience. When you're done, use Appreciate mode to bask in the natural beauty of the ecosystem you have restored.\n\n--- Heatwave Update ---\n\nHeatwave brings a blistering new challenge of the arid climate to Terra Nil, introducing a whole new region to restore. Featuring three unique maps, 13 new animals, 10 new buildings, and five new biomes to transform the desolate into the flourishing. An improved animal system and a new photography mode give you more ways to interact with and appreciate the ecosystems you create.\n\nThe new arid maps offer striking environments and creative restoration puzzles, from vast grassland savannahs, to sublime deserts, and verdant acacia forests. Coax greenery from salt pans and riverbeds choked with alien vegetation on the edge of the Parched Dunes. Bridge a vast canyon, douse oil fires, and restore a cactus-filled desert using the remote-controlled ERW1N recycling bot on the Canyon Peaks. Clean up a former oil field, creating muddy watering holes for all manner of fauna, and bring diversity back to theFracked Floodplain.\n\nTo complement these dramatic landscapes, the wildlife system is more approachable and rewarding, with 13 new animals, including elephants, lions, crocodiles, and giraffes, that appear more naturally and stay longer. The new photography system lets you capture your favorite moments, earning stars for creative snapshots of happy animals and lush habitats, which you can keep in your trusty handbook\n\nDeepen the sense of wonder and accomplishment at the heart of Terra Nil, as you bring life back to even the harshest places in Heatwave, the most significant and hottest content update to date.",
