	"description": "Ever miss being a child, playing games at your grandma's or in your old bedroom? Then look no further! The Adventures of Elena Temple is the classic you never knew existed. And the best part is that you can play it on virtual old machines that kind of sort of maybe existed. It's not like you can remember for sure anyway, right?\n\nThe game is a monochromatic puzzle platformer made to look as if it were created in the 80s. Overcome obstacles, figure out how to collect all the coins, find all the gems and remember your childhood while doing it! Progress through the game's dungeon through non-linear exploration and keep an open eye for secrets to find.\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 A dungeon of 50+ rooms to overcome, each its own mini-level\n\u2022 Open exploration, choose which way to go, but don't worry, a helpful map is just one button press away\n\u2022 Challenging, old-school platforming\n\u2022 Collect as many coins as you want, but we both know you want them all\n\u2022 Coins will make you rich, but there's no escaping the dungeon without all the gems\n\u2022 Secret scrolls to find for the more observant player\n\u2022 Best of all, play the game on a selection of 7 virtual old machines, from the Pomo D'or 4, to Maple and Some Toy and all the way to the NS-Bos PC\n\nHeads up!\nThe Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can play on seven simulated machines. Aside from the different look, the game plays the same on all machines and has the exact same content! The purpose of these old machines is to remind you of the old days, so feel free to pick whichever you like best without any fear of missing out on game content.\n\nI'm a solo indie developer, I loved making The Adventures of Elena Temple and I hope you enjoy it! Thank you for your support!",
