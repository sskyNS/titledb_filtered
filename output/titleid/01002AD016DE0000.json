Protect yourself, slow your enemies, become incredibly powerful and even visit other dimensions, but be careful... the drinks may be toxic! Some of them can make you feel a little fuzzy. \nDo you often feel nostalgic? Check out the \"old-school\" mode, which will take you on a journey through the pixelated version of the game! Get a taste of the good, old days!\nSpend hours tearing up any demon who stands in your way! Watch the blood spurt everywhere and leave the pile of corpses in your wake!",
