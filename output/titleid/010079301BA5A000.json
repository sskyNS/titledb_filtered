	"description": "Ready to build the zoo of your dreams? Depart on wild adventures to find exotic fauna, exploring all manner of environments from savanna to tundra, jungle and beyond! Give your new animal friends a home and take your zoo to the top of the industry!\n\nSavor the thrill of opening day. Feed the animals in your burgeoning lineup\u2014even give them the occasional treat to show you care! From apples to acorns, meat, and more, tailor your critters' diet according to their natural habitat. On that note, do the same with the surrounding flora too!\n\nYour customers will also require expert care. Develop your zoo's infrastructure, installing benches, fountains, and the odd hot dog stand to make sure zoo-goers stay satisfied till close. Propel your place to mega-park proportions and you'll even be able to start an on-site shuttle!\n\nWhat's more, if you're lucky, two of your critters who share the same pen may find romance\u2014resulting in the grand gift of life! Potential partners can be found via the Animal Hub or when out exploring. But be forewarned; the latter method requires animals be won over through a heated battle of negotiation!\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Build a top-ranking zoo, set social media ablaze, and show the world your wild side!\n\nTry searching for \"Kairosoft\" to see all of our games!!",
