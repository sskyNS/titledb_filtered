	"description": "This game was released in 1987 in Japan as a role-playing game. The player learns from their bedridden mother that their father, who had gone missing, actually fell in battle against Crimson, leading them to vow to defeat Crimson.\n\nThe game progresses by moving across the field map, exploring dungeons, and recruiting companions. It features a traditional system with random encounters and command-based combat. However, the game introduces its own unique tempo with features like no encounters on the field map, attacks not executing if the target is already defeated, and a lower hit accuracy in combat.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
