	"description": "Forestrike is a martial arts roguelite inspired by classic martial arts movies, where every fight is unique, and every death brings you closer to victory.\n\nA martial artist, named Yu, embarks on a journey across the country to free the Emperor from an evil Admiral\u2019s influence. As the odds become more and more overwhelming, it\u2019s clear Yu will need more than his fists to overcome the Admiral\u2019s vicious followers.\n\nEnter \u2018Foresight\u2019, a mysterious technique allowing Yu to rehearse each encounter within the fortress of his mind. Mastering the fight before it begins won't guarantee victory in reality, but it will give Yu a fighting chance. Every single move matters when death comes at a price - beginning his journey all over again.\n\nWinning won\u2019t always mean Yu will emerge from each encounter unscathed, so careful planning will be required to navigate each randomly generated world map, making use of Inns for rest and the wisdom of wise Masters he\u2019ll meet along the way.\n\nThe further he travels, the stronger Yu will become, eventually learning new techniques from five eccentric Masters that provide permanent upgrades. Combine and experiment with these techniques to achieve Yu\u2019s ultimate goal - victory without \u2018Foresight\u2019.\n\nForewarned is Forearmed\nThe \u2018Foresight\u2019, a distinctive game mechanic that lets players experiment without consequences before fighting for real - and win or die trying. Forestrike\u2019s roguelite game loop generates unique runs and encounters every time, so adaptation and improvisation are crucial to progress and earn the ultimate victory - winning without \u2018Foresight\u2019.\n\nVisceral Kung Fu Combat\nAlways outnumbered, learn to dispatch mobs of brutal enemies with poise and efficiency using everything at your disposal. Upgrade and customize your movesets with techniques from your chosen Masters to help you outwit your opponents in fierce, puzzle-like battles.\n\nHandcrafted Fantasy\nJourney through a visually striking fantasy world inhabited by unique characters, vicious enemies and magical revelations. Intricate pixel art landscapes form an atmospheric backdrop to handcrafted animation and characters.",
