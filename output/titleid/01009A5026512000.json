	"description": "Grab your towels because the chillest capybara in gaming is ready for a soak! In Capy Spa, you help Pipa, a relaxation-loving capybara, push herb buckets into hot springs to prepare the perfect bath.\n\nWith 30 carefully crafted levels, two charming biomes (Savanna River and Forest Onsen), and a soothing soundtrack that blends with the rising steam, every stage invites calm and thoughtful moves.\n\nNo enemies, no timer, no rush. The focus is on smart movement, experimenting, undoing, and trying again until you find the perfect sequence. Sometimes, pools start already filled, and you\u2019ll need to reorganize everything with patience and logic.\n\nIt feels like solving a puzzle while watching steam dance and leaves drift by. Each completed level brings that quiet satisfaction of seeing Pipa\u2019s spa finally ready to relax.\n\nCapy Spa is the kind of puzzle that makes you smile in peace, turning simple bucket-pushing into a zen and delightful experience.",
