	"description": "Soccer is a third person football game where you control and see each player individually, making every action feel direct, personal, and more intense than classic top down or broadcast style football games. You are always close to the action, watching your player run, defend, and attack in real time, which makes every match feel dynamic and exciting.\n\nThanks to a ball physics system based on the game engine, every pass, shot, bounce, and deflection feels natural and unpredictable, creating immersive gameplay where no two situations play out exactly the same. Even with its humorous and cartoon like visual style, where players have oversized big heads, the game still delivers a fun and satisfying football experience that rewards timing, positioning, and smart play.\n\nThe game includes several difficulty modes, starting with Training to learn the controls and understand the basics, then moving on to Easy, Medium, Hard, and finally Champions for players who want the highest level of challenge and competitive gameplay. Each difficulty increases the speed, precision, and overall intensity of the matches, pushing you to improve your skills and decision making.",
