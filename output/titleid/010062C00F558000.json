Which he doesn\u2019t really care much for the details so he just does.\n\nHis journey however starts in a magical fountain which splits Filo\u2019s essence into hundreds of clones each shaped by an individual part of his personality which are called Me\u2019s. \n\nHowever they are all a part of him so they are compelled to move when he does. Me\u2019s as well as Filo now also have the ability to turn into magical stone platforms which can be used for puzzle solving.\n\nEating transmitter fruits changes the properties of the transformations. Filo can also work with the other Me\u2019s to do special dances to allow them to transform into creatures like the Jellysaur or the Tankephaunt. He runs into other characters like Flora who seems to be a fan girl. Filo is supposed to be going after The organization called Cloud 9 in the world of Xio, runny Baron Vost.
