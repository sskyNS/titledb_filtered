	"intro": "Breakout is back! Choice Provisions has flipped the legendary series on its head. Or rather side.",
	"description": "In this neon-drenched take on the classic, you\u2019ll need to literally break through each puzzle by clearing bricks to breach the final goal. Longer play will rack up a combo and increase the intensity of the effects creating a spectacular light show as a reward for the most skilled players.\n\nSpecial blocks will grant an edge like large brick-clearing blasts, a barrier that\u2019ll save your ball, and a laser cannon to clear a path. Each one will reward players with dazzling dynamic effects that create an excitement that hasn\u2019t been seen in Breakout before. \n\nEach of the 72 levels will push your skills to the limit, but you won\u2019t be without help. A focus mode will allow you to slow down time at the expense of your score. Or, if you want some help and company, you can tag in a friend to play through the entire game in local two-player co-op.\n\nFeatures\n\n- 72 levels that will push your brick-breaking skills to the test\n- Unlockable endless mode with an online global leaderboard\n- Two-player co-op to manage the chaos with a friend\n- Procedural audio and visual effects that ramp up with your combo",
