Whatever their plan is, you must put a stop to it\u2026 or face unspeakable consequences. \n\nFor the first time in his life, Sherlock is truly afraid.

Lovecraft and face Eldritch horrors beyond human comprehension.\n- Fight encroaching insanity as you pursue answers to questions that have no rational explanation whatsoever\n- Find clues that will lead you through the famous Baker Street in London, a haunting psych ward in Switzerland, the perilous Louisiana wetlands and more\n- A reimagining of the 2008 title: Rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine, The Awakened boasts modern graphics and animations, an expanded storyline, numerous side quests and new mechanics including unique insanity gameplay.
