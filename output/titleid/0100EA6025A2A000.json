	"description": "The gates are locked, the line is long, and the air is thick with tension\u2014and possibly zombie breath. You\u2019re the last barrier between the living and the undead, armed with scanners, test kits, and a gut feeling that might save the world.\n\nEvery day, a parade of desperate faces shuffles toward your checkpoint\u2014some harmless, some sick, and some hiding something far worse. One wrong call, and you might just let a walking biohazard waltz right in.\n\nInspect every ID, scan every bag, and keep an eye on that guy who\u2019s sweating way too much for a chilly day. Supplies are scarce, time is short, and the infected are getting clever. Upgrade your gear, train your instincts, and hold your ground as the outbreak evolves.\n\nThe fate of humanity is in your hands\u2014so no pressure. Just remember: if someone starts groaning and craving brains, that\u2019s not your cue to hand them a visitor\u2019s badge.",
