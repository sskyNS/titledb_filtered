It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side.\n\nOn the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance\u2014as she speaks with the devil himself.\n\nIndika\u2019s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov.\n\nENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES\n\nThe subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika\u2019s journey and she\u2019ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey.\n\nOdd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan. Its members put aesthetics at the forefront and aren\u2019t afraid to tread the fine line of ethical norms. Their game is a great testament to that, as INDIKA constitutes an open challenge to the industry's established approach to creating video games.\n\n",
