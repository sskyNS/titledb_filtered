	"description": "Enter the interdimensional war and defend the future of the Infinos Federation.\n\nDecades after a devastating conflict with the Argus army, the galaxy had enjoyed a fragile peace. The formation of the Infinos Federation allowed for reconstruction of war-torn regions and the strengthening of defenses. But that stability shatters when an observation vessel in orbit around Graria detects a mysterious interdimensional rift\u2014then vanishes without a trace.\n\nA reconnaissance team is dispatched and uncovers a massive distortion gate erected by Argus forces, poised to launch a new offensive. Unprepared, Infinos units suffer defeat after defeat until the enemy overruns the home planet. In a bold gambit, Federation commanders decide to strike back at Argus at its source. The AT-Fauria interceptor takes off as the last line of defense and the galaxy\u2019s greatest hope.\n\nInfinos 2 is a 2D horizontal shoot \u2019em up crafted as a loving tribute to the golden age of Japanese arcade classics. Pixel-perfect art, relentless action and tight, accessible mechanics combine to deliver an experience that\u2019s instantly engaging yet rewards mastery. Each level unfolds a unique setting, fresh enemies and bosses with intricate attack patterns.\n\nEight intense levels await: above Infinos, you battle to reclaim an invaded orbital base; then around a strategic satellite; on the ravaged surface of Graria; inside a hidden Argus command outpost; through a warped dimension of giant insectoid foes and gravity anomalies; and finally three classified zones where reality itself seems to unravel for only the bravest pilots.\n\nAccessible to newcomers yet deep enough for scoring veterans, Infinos 2 balances pick-up-and-play simplicity with a steep skill ceiling. Its pixel art evokes the arcade era with modern polish, while a driving synth soundtrack heightens the drama of every firefight.",
