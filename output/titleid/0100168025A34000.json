	"description": "Cookie\u2019s Trails is a cozy tactical puzzle set in a post-apocalyptic world with a sweet twist. The player guides a friendly hamster survivor through zombie-filled trails, collecting baseball bats and medical kits to safely reach the camp.\n\nThe hexagonal path tiles can be rotated and repositioned, creating continuous and strategic routes. Each level requires all tiles to be used, combining obstacles, enemies, and resources in creative ways. Zombies block progress, baseball bats allow defeating them, and medical kits heal wounds, but only in specific positions.\n\nThe game features 30 stages that grow in size and complexity, introducing new tile types, multiple survivors, and challenges that demand careful coordination. To win, players must plan each move and find the perfect route to the camp.\n\nCompleting a level ensures progression, but reaching the camp without injuries grants a special cookie-shaped star, encouraging replayability and the search for more optimized solutions.\n\nCombining strategy, charm, and a unique atmosphere, Cookie\u2019s Trails is the perfect choice for fans of challenging and personality-filled puzzles.",
