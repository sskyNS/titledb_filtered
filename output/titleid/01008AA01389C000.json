	"description": "\nTo The Rescue!is a dog shelter simulator where you are responsible for taking care of dozens of cute dogs in need of homes. It's not all cuddles and snoot boops though: running a shelter can be a lot of work. You have to manage all of the dogs' needs in order to maximize their chances of finding the right forever homes.\n\nEach day brings new challenges and rewards. Dogs have specific preferences, can get infectious diseases, and can have negative traits. But you can also hold fundraisers, get random donations, and, if you work hard, help someone find their new best friend. Unfortunately, there's never enough room, and always more dogs.\n\nSome dogs are more desirable than others, but maybe if you can afford to wait long enough, just maybe, every dog will have their day.\n\n20% of the profit from all sales of To The Rescue! goes towards real dog shelters through our charity partner the PetFinder Foundation.\n\nEvery dog is unique.\nEach dog is generated with its own traits and preferences to make them distinctive and memorable.\nMatch dogs with adopters' needs. Adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.\nUpgrade and customize your shelter.If you end up with some spare funds, you can upgrade the shelter to have deluxe kennels, get help with cleaning or upkeep, and more!\nKeep the shelter open.Sometimes it can be tough to afford to take care of all the dogs in the shelter. You'll need to be thrifty and sometimes make tough decisions so that you can keep helping dogs find homes.\n...and yes, of course you can pet the dogs!\nTake Care of Dogs\n\nEvery dog is unique -  Each dog is generated with its own traits, food preferences, personalities, health quirks, names, training values, and more to make them unique and memorable. With 28 different breed variants, there are all kinds of dogs to take care of and show to potential adopters. These adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.\nFulfill their needs - Dogs need food, water, and shelter. They also need to be kept clean and happy. It's up to you, as the main employee of the shelter, to take care of them. It can get hectic, but it's all worth it to see them find their forever homes. \nMinigames - For a break from the hectic day-to-day, there are other ways you can ensure that dogs are well taken care of. There are 4 minigames: Tug O\u2019 War, Itchy Scritch, Fetch, and Bathtime\n\nBalance the Budget - The shelter runs on donations and adoptions, and there are multiple ways to spend your money. You'll have to manage your budget to make sure that you can pay for food, vaccines, and other unexpected expenses. \nEach day brings new challenges - In addition to your regular daily upkeep tasks and costs, random events can disrupt the routine. Diseases can break out and spread, new dogs can show up at the wrong time, and tough decisions will have to be made.\nGrow and Upgrade - Upgrade your shelter to increase the number of dogs you can house, make it more efficient to feed and water them, and make the shelter dogs as comfortable as you can. It's your shelter: guide how it grows!\n\n\n\n\nEvent-driven story - In To The Rescue!'s main story mode you can progress from housing dogs in your own garage to running a giant, efficient shelter of your own. There will always be events that keep you on your toes, and story threads that develop between them. \nFostering and Adopting - The most important part of running a shelter is helping animals find homes. Match dogs' traits with the preferences of visitors to maximize their chances of finding homes. Find fosters who can take care of dogs when you don't have room. \nIn-Game Community Impact - It's not just the shelter activities that you have to manage; you also must establish the shelter as part of the community. Host events, promote, educate, and make sure that you stay in a positive light.\n\n\n",
