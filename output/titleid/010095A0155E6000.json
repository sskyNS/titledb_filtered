	"description": "Bela Lugosi returns as Prince Dracula in this classicvania horror platformer! Battle your way through the monster plagued countryside, evade deadly traps and pitfalls, overcome Dracula\u2019s commanders in single combat, and discover the secret history of your monstrous foes. The night awaits you!\n\nTransylvania - 1451. The plague of Dracula's army continues to spread across the Carpathians, growing stronger with each victim it claims. Those who attempt to resist are met with a fate worse than death. If Dracula is not stopped, he will bring everlasting night to the world.\n\nOnly two champions have answered the call to bring divine justice to Dracula and his minions. Abbot Dorin, warrior monk and leader of the Kelemen Monastery, and Irina Dracul, vampire, pyromancer, and ancestor of Prince Dracula, have joined together to drive back the Army of the Dead and hunt down the legendary vampire himself. Zombies, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and demonic beings of every kind await all who dare trespass into their master's domain! Those who survive the horrors of the Borgo Pass will reach the gates of the ancient Castle Dracula, where the real nightmare begins!\n\nCarpathian Night is a tribute to retro horror side-scrollers and the classic monster films that inspired them. Battle your way through legions of iconic monsters, avoid deadly traps, uncover the secret history of your monstrous foes, and face the legendary Lord of the Vampires within his own ancestral home! Answer the call, mighty hunter, and drive the wickedness back from whence it came!\n\nIn partnership with Lugosi Enterprises, Tezcatek is honored to bring Bela Lugosi into the video game realm for the first time in an officially licensed release, in a style of game that has long been associated with the horror classics.",
