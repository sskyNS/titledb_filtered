	"description": "Balls vs. Tombs is a dark fantasy action-survival game built around a single, haunting purpose: to reclaim stolen souls and restore peace to a desecrated graveyard.\n\nOnce, the cemetery was a place of rest. A sacred ground where spirits slept quietly beneath stone and soil. That balance was shattered when four colossal abominations emerged from the depths, corrupting the land and absorbing every soul bound to the graves. As the spirits were torn from their resting places, the monsters grew stronger, warping the cemetery into a battlefield of rage, decay, and despair.\n\nYou are one of the few who can fight back.\n\nCORE GAMEPLAY\n\nAt its heart, Balls vs. Tombs is a fast-paced combat experience where precision, positioning, and elemental mastery matter. You fight by launching powerful orbs\u2014your primary weapons against waves of enraged spirits and corrupted entities.\n\nThe core loop is simple but deep:\n\nDefeat corrupted enemies\n\nRecover their trapped souls\n\nReturn souls to restored graves\n\nExpand and cleanse the cemetery\n\nUnlock new characters, powers, and combinations\n\nEach reclaimed grave brings the world closer to balance\u2014and brings you closer to confronting the true source of the corruption.\n\nELEMENTAL CHARACTERS & ORBS\n\nBeyond the basic orb, the game features four unlockable characters, each bound to a unique elemental sphere:\n\nWater Orb \u2013 fluid control, slowing enemies and shaping the battlefield\n\nAir Orb \u2013 speed, mobility, and precision strikes\n\nPoison Orb \u2013 damage over time, area corruption, and attrition\n\nFire Orb \u2013 raw power, explosive impact, and aggressive play\n\nEach character fundamentally changes how the game feels, encouraging experimentation and mastery.\n\nFUSION SYSTEM \u2013 THE HEART OF POWER\n\nWhat truly sets Balls vs. Tombs apart is its Orb Fusion System.\n\nEvery elemental orb can be fused with every other orb.\n\nWater + Fire\nAir + Poison\nFire + Air\nPoison + Water\n\u2026and every possible combination in between.\n\nEach fusion creates a new, more powerful hybrid orb with unique behaviors, visuals, and combat effects. Some fusions focus on crowd control, others on burst damage, chain reactions, or battlefield dominance.\n\nThis system turns combat into a strategic sandbox, rewarding creativity and experimentation. The more you understand the elements, the more devastating your builds become.\n\nTHE CEMETERY AS PROGRESSION\n\nThere is no traditional level select.\n\nThe graveyard itself is your progression system.\n\nAs you rescue souls and rebuild graves:\n\nNew cemetery zones unlock\n\nStronger enemy types begin to appear\n\nNew characters and orb types become available\n\nThe world visually transforms from corruption to sanctified ground\n\nWhat feels like an open, evolving environment is actually a carefully structured progression arc\u2014a living level system disguised as world restoration.\n\nBOSSES & NARRATIVE\n\nThe four great monsters are not random enemies. Each represents a twisted force that feeds on unrest and unfinished souls. As they absorb spirits, they grow in size, power, and presence\u2014something reflected both in gameplay and cinematic moments.\n\nTHE GOAL\n\nThis is not just about surviving waves.\n\nIt\u2019s about bringing peace back to the dead.\n\nEvery soul you recover matters.\nEvery grave you restore reshapes the world.\nEvery fusion you master brings you closer to ending the corruption.\n\nWelcome to Balls vs. Tombs.\nThe dead are waiting.",
