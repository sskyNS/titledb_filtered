	"intro": "Blast through shapes and numbers in this addictive hand-drawn arcade shooter!",
	"description": "Fire from a moving cannon at expanding geometric shapes like circles, squares, and triangles. Aim to hit as many as you can with a single shot, as a new shape will emerge where the fired bullet lands. Each figure displays a number indicating how many hits it takes to destroy it, so strategize your shots wisely. It's not all about a good aim, but also smart planning and anticipating what's coming next!\u00a0\n\nCollect bombs that crush through your targets, or hit extra life points to keep the fun going. Be careful though - newly formed shapes can effectively block your options, and if a fired bullet goes back behind the line of your cannon, you'll lose one life!\u00a0Decide whether it's worth risking a tricky shot to collect a helpful power-up before it disappears, or choose a safer option.\n\n\u2022 Enjoy easy to understand, yet skill based gameplay\n\u2022 Collect useful power-ups to help you in your struggles\n\u2022 Top your scores in the leaderboards\n\u2022 Admire hand-drawn graphics and cool sound effects\u00a0",
