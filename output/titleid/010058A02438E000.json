	"intro": "Fuwa Fuwa, a maid cafe on its last legs.\nBy a twist of fate, you've become the boss.\nNow turn things around with four adorable maids!",
	"description": "\u201cUm, please be the new manager of the cafe!\u201d\n Fuwa Fuwa Cafe\u2014a maid cafe tucked away in a quiet part of Nipponbashi, and where a wonderful encounter is about to take place...\n You, the protagonist, quit your job at an extremely toxic workplace and find yourself at a run-down maid cafe, where a cute maid named Shiro works.\n At first, you only agree to become the new manager because it conveniently met all your urgent needs, but soon the colorful maids Miyu, Favna, and Honoka join in. And as you spend time with them and meet the people of Electric Street, both you and the cafe will gradually liven up once more.\n\n Maid Cafe on Electric Street is a game set in Nipponbashi, the heart of Osaka\u2019s otaku culture. This is a story-focused adventure game where you enjoy daily life at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. Make yourself a cup of coffee, relax, and immerse yourself in a heartwarming story.\n\n \u25a04 Cute, Memorable Heroines\nEnjoy voice-acted conversations with the four maids, all with distinct personalities.\n \u2665Shiro (VA: Ikumi Hasegawa)\n A maid who loves Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. A huge otaku for anime and video games, she talks really fast when she\u2019s gushing about the things she loves, and often splurges on merch without thinking whenever she visits an anime shop. A little clumsy, but works hard every day to become the cute maid she\u2019s always wanted to be.\n\n \u2665Miyu (VA: Ayasa Itou)\n A game otaku and gyaru with a big appetite. Loves both eating and cooking, and apparently really enjoys serving her cooking to customers at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. Is actually Shiro's friend on the online game Magic Angel, so they knew each other before actually meeting in real life.\n\n \u2665Favna (VA: Sayumi Suzushiro)\n A mysterious girl dressed in gothic Lolita fashion. Speaks in riddles and demands the protagonist become her familiar. She sometimes accidentally drops the edgy act when she's taken by surprise though, so maybe she's just got a serious case of chuunibyou...?\n\n \u2665Honoka (VA: Yui Ishikawa)\n A girl with a Kansaiben dialect who works as a shrine maiden at her family shrine. Practically in charge of the shrine, she is reliable and very good at handling money! Is actually a doujin author...?\n\n \u25a0The Daily Life with the Four Maids of Fuwa Fuwa Cafe\n As the manager of Fuwa Fuwa, you\u2019ll live in Nipponbashi, Osaka and spend time with your favorite maid... or maids. Go shopping, watch a movie, go for karaoke, buy a present for a special someone... What you choose to do, and with whom, will affect the ending of the story.\n\n \u25a0Make Fuwa Fuwa Cafe Famous!\nAs the manager, it's your job to run the cafe. Improve the maids' work skills, optimize their roles, and drive up profits. The money you earn can be spent on shopping, food, capsule toys and more!\n\n \u25a0The Stunning Sights of Nipponbashi\n Visit stores you can find in the real Nipponbashi, such as Surugaya, Sofmap, Dragon Star, Super Potato, and Karaoke Rainbow, among the many others we've collaborated with.\n Go shopping by yourself or go on dates with the maids and enjoy life in otaku heaven. But don't stay out too late; you still have a cafe to run!\n\n \u25a0Collectable Capsule Toys\n In this game, you can try to collect your favorite capsule toy series and experience that unique gacha thrill of not knowing what you're getting. Keep cranking those machines until you've collected them all!\n\n Other than capsule toys, there's more merch for you to collect, like video games, books, and figures. You can also decorate your room and watch as your collections reach completion!",
