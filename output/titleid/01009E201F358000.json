	"intro": "Catch up to 220 real-life bugs and display them in your bug zoo",
	"description": "You've just bought an abandoned Insectarium (bug zoo)\u2014congratulations! Now, go catch real-life bugs, build your collection, and level up your skills. Bug & Seek features a very simple and peaceful gameplay loop, no stress, and no wrong choices. So relax and enjoy all those bugs (and learn about them too)!\n\nFeatures:\n\nDiscover 200+ adorable and real insects: Every bug comes with a humorous tagline and a codex entry with facts presented by the bug itself, and each bug can be found in seasons, locations and at times that mirror real life. Change the way you view the world around you (and especially under your feet).\n\nCustomize and Expand Your Insectarium: Build new wings to the Insectarium and create the best display the town has ever known. And of course, fill it with bugs!\n\nExplore The World: Bugs live in every kind of habitat: from meadows, deserts, and forests to wetlands, beaches, urban environments, and caves. And wouldn't you know it? Bug & Seek has all of these!\n\nMeet the Locals: From the mayor to the herb farmer, meet the 19+ locals of Buggburg and perform quests for them to earn special gear and items, secrets and gossip, and maybe even haikus \n\nSolve the Mystery: One year ago someone broke into the Insectarium in the middle of the night and stole all of the bugs in an incident known as The Great Bug Heist. See if you can piece together what really happened as you solve the mystery and unmask the guilty party!\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\n\u2014Simple Game Mechanics: Explore, shake objects to reveal hiding bugs, and swing your net. Bug & Seek was meant to be easy, peaceful, and stress-free. A leveling system increases the rarity of bugs you can catch, and some special items boost your chances too.\n\n\u2014A Bug-Based Economy: To earn money, you will have to sell bugs at the stores and for jobs and quests. But don't worry, you will be able to catch more!\n\n\u2014Cozy, Humorous Vibes: The cute little town of Buggburg to explore, lots of goofy and bug-obsessed NPC's, bugs with personalities and jokes, and a fun mystery about someone stealing a bunch of bugs.\n\n\u2014Light Customization: There are a handful of adorable new decoration sets, and even a few new clothing items you can acquire. \n\n\u2014Real Facts and Information: Every bug in the game is a real bug, and you'll learn things like why bugs are so important to biodiversity and environmental health.\n\nWhat Bug & Seek DOES NOT have:\n\n\u2014Challenging gameplay; again, the gameplay loop in Bug & Seek is very simple.\n\n\u2014Mini games; if you swing your net at a bug, you will catch it.\n\n\u2014Energy meters or sleep requirements; after all, you can only catch certain bugs at night.\n\n\u2014Multiplayer options;\n\n\u2014Combat; while bugs in real life do attack and eat other bugs, they don't in Bug & Seek, and you won't fight NPC's with your bugs. The bugs also do not carry swords or wear medieval armor, as fun as that might sound.\n\n\u2014Romance; while you can talk to NPC's, and do jobs for them involving catching bugs, you cannot romance them, nor can you romance the bugs, regardless of the superpowers that might give to your offspring.",
