	"intro": "This is a clicker game about a mayonnaise jar. It\u2019s also creamy, dreamy and properly sequel-y!",
	"description": "Right in the middle of the Next-Gen hurricane, comes the true next-gen game everyone\u2019s been waiting for! ...Not this one; but it\u2019s close!

Is this a sequel to My Name is Mayo?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Why would you do such a thing??\nA: Isolation in 2020 has been interesting to say the least.

Is it still a clicker?\nA: Yup. Click the Mayo jar and the gameplay will \u201cclick\u201d with you right away! \u201cTap\u201d into the psyche of Mayo and \u201cMouse-y\u201d along the quirky stories!\n\nQ: Please no more puns...\nA: I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave... (We hope one of you is named Dave)",
