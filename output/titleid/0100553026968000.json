Their power rises with every passing minute, challenging your resilience and mastery.\nDefend the New Year, preserve the spirit of celebration, and prove that monastic magic can stand against any darkness. Step into the fray, unleash the full potential of the monk, and become a legend whose name echoes louder than festive bells.",
