The caller tells him they wish to reveal the truth behind the virus used in the attacks two years ago...\nSkeptical, he nevertheless follows the directions he has been given and finds himself arriving at a deserted mansion.\nWhat he encounters there is beyond belief...\n\n\u3010Game Play\u3011\nThe aim of the game is to use a range of weapons, including handguns, shotguns, and rocket launchers, to defeat terrifying monsters and escape from the mansion and laboratory.\nThis survival-action horror game is a classic FPS.

This management of the limited items available creates gameplay imbued with a sense of palpable tension.\nThe game also features multiple endings, meaning that the game's conclusion changes dramatically based on the player's actions.\n\n\u3010Audio\u3011\nThe first game to feature the independently developed Enhanced Real Sound Effect (ERSE) audio system.\nThe atmosphere generated by the 3D audio effects creates a brand-new horror experience unlike anything seen before.\n\n\u3010Game Overview\u3011\nTitle: QuietMansion1\nGenre: FPS survival action horror\nHashtag: #QuietMansion",
