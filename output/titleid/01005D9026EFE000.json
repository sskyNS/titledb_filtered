	"description": "Welcome to WHY ME, a brutal rage-platformer where survival is earned one agonizing jump at a time. You\u2019ve been thrown into a dungeon filled with shifting platforms, deadly traps, and relentless chaos. The question is simple: will you escape, or will the dungeon break you first?\n\nEvery room is a new test of patience and precision. Spikes, fire, collapsing floors, and tricks designed to catch you off guard will punish even the smallest mistake. But with every failure comes another chance to learn, improve, and push just a little bit further.\n\nWHY ME is not just about surviving\u2014it\u2019s about enduring the rage. Designed for players who crave challenge, it rewards quick thinking, sharp reflexes, and stubborn determination. Lose yourself in the cycle of frustration and triumph as you climb higher, escape further, and uncover the mystery behind your imprisonment.\n\nOne wrong step could end it all\u2014but one perfect run might just prove you\u2019ve got what it takes.",
