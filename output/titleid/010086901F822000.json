	"intro": "Jeff Minter is back with another unique take on a 1980s Atari arcade game.",
	"description": "Reimagined in Minter\u2019s signature assault of colors, shapes and sounds, this new take on the eclectic arcade title is built from the ground up with new challenges, new twists, and a whole lot of llamas.\n\nThe premise of I, Robot is simple: You take control of an ox-headed robot on a mission to outwit the all-seeing eye. In each level, you\u2019ll navigate across tiles, flipping each tile to proceed to the next. Make sure you don\u2019t jump while the eye\u2019s watching, or you\u2019ll be zapped away in a flash. If you make it across the tiles, you\u2019ll race down a tube blasting away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you. And you have to do all this inside of the 3D space of Minter\u2019s kaleidoscopic visualizer.\n\nDon\u2019t get too comfortable, Minter has also thrown in some arena levels that challenge you to pick out and blast an onslaught of lethal enemies.\n\nAt its core it is a game that only Llamasoft could have made. A cacophony of colors dazzle your eyes as the music gradually builds up based on your progress. If you want to take a break from the arcade action, jump into the ungame, where you can channel your inner Jeff Minter and play around with all the sights and sounds from the game.\n\nFeatures\n\n- 55 levels with a variety of challenges to conquer in each\n- Unique tube-shooter bonus stages between each level\n- Llamasoft's unique brand of mind melting visuals\n- Procedural music that builds as you rack up a high score\n- Earn your bragging rights in the online leaderboards\n",
