	"description": "*About This Game\n\nOut-think the Enemy in Chaotic Capture-the-Flag Battles\nAmass an army of slimes and compete to capture more flags than your opponent in hyper-fast, best-of-3 RTS battles!\n\n- Command your Slimes\nEach slime can harvest \"Magic Fruits\" that can grow more slimes, attack enemy slimes, or capture flags. \nThe more slimes allocated to a task, the faster it completes! Will you grow your army first for a surprise early-game attack, or sneak in an early flag-capture?\n\n- Watch Out for Guardians\nGargantuan Guardians linger throughout the map, eager to crush both you and your slimes with a single blow. Guide them away by getting inside their attack range (but not too close!), then strategically draw Guardians away so slimes can continue their duties. Try luring Guardians into enemy range to create near-impassable choke points!\n\n- Raise Walls to Redirect Enemy Movement\nForce the opponent to take the long route back to their base with well-placed walls.\n\n- Cast Spells to Turn the Tides of Battle\nSearch through the map for power-ups, like lightning strikes that instantly turn enemy armies into mush, ticking bombs, meteor showers, and more. Summon a trio of friendly Guardians to do your bidding, activate a speed boost, or go invisible for sneaky maneuvering across the map.\n\n*Multiple Game Modes\n\n- Random Battle:\nCompete against players from all over the world online!\n\n- Private Battle: \nPlay online with friends using a shared password!\n\n- Split-Screen Battle: \nCompete against friends and family on a single screen!\n\n- Solo Missions: \nMaster your skills in a dedicated single-player mode by completing various challenges!",
