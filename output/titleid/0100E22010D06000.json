	"description": "Have you ever wanted to have deep, meaningful conversations with a smoldering poltergeist who terrorizes rich men in Vegas? How about a ghost dog looking for his owner? Or maybe you'd rather rob a bank? \nGhosts are into all sorts of things.\nPart horror, part comedy, and kinda sorta heartbreaking, Speed Dating for Ghosts is a game like no other about finding companionship and closure in the afterlife. \nMeet more than a dozen ghosts of oh so many backgrounds, genders, and time periods. Learn how they died, as well as how they lived, then help them find peace... if they like you enough to open up first. \nBased on what you say and how you say it, some dates may turn ugly. Not everyone gets along, even in the afterlife.\nRue Morgue's Best Indie Game of 2018 is finally on Nintendo Switch\u2122. For the first time, you can date Gary, Hattie, Kyo, and so many other spooky customers on the bus, on the couch, in a library, wherever you take your game!",
