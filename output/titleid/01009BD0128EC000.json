	"description": "Super Squidlit imitates the Game Boy\u2122 Color's capabilities and limitations for a squishy adventure! The colorful world of Squishu and its invertebrate inhabitants need your help! Play as Plip and your old foe, Skwit Skwot, as you set sail to banish a great evil.\n\n- Squip your way through the islands of Squishu as Plip, a wee squidlit that can double jump to ink on things below you!\n\n- Plip's new roll tackle lets you manipulate foes and gain a burst of speed!\n\n- Blast your way through enemies as the wizardly Skwit Skwot, GOD EMPEROR, in ray-casting 3D RPG levels!\n\n- Meet lots of goofy Squidlits!\n\nLike the first Squidlit game did with the Game Boy\u2122, Super Squidlit adheres to the limitations of the Game Boy\u2122 Color:\n* No more than 10 sprites in a horizontal line\n* No more than 40 sprites at any time\n* 3 colors per sprite\n* 160 x 144 pixel resolution\n* 4 sound channels for music and SFX\n* All sounds were recorded on a real Game Boy\u2122 Color!\n\nCan you guide Plip and Skwit Skwot to victory and save Squishu?",
