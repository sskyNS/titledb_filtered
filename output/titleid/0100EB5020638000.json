	"description": "With the construction of the interstellar warp device \"Gravity Catapult\" for space exploration, humanity ventured into three neighboring star systems. However, due to the rapid and extensive nature of this colonization, law enforcement from the Federal Patrol couldn't keep up, leading to deteriorating security in some regions. To counter this situation, the federal headquarters put bounties on notorious criminals and began recruiting individuals to become hunters to take them down... Ten years later, one day, A-class hunter Brian Wright infiltrated a criminal organization's secret base alone but found himself in a dire situation when his starship was destroyed.\n\n\"Star Cruiser\" is an action RPG released by Arsys Software in 1988 in Japan. The game's most notable feature is its use of polygons to represent everything from vast outer space to dungeons, the player's ship, people, and trees. This use of polygons to depict the universe was a significant technical achievement that impressed users at a time when polygons were not yet widespread in the gaming industry.\n\nIn addition to its polygonal graphics, the game is known for its unique system that combines 3D action and RPG elements, a storyline that pleasantly surprises players, and characters with charmingly smug dialogues. Even 36 years after its release, the game remains an enjoyable experience.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n*There are scenes with flashing screens, so if you feel any discomfort, please stop playing the game. Also, those who have experienced such symptoms should refrain from playing it.",
