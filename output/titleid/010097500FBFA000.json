	"description": "The successful simulation series (including \"Firefighters - The Simulation\", \"Firefighters: Plant Fire Department\") is starting a new round. In Firefighters - Airport Heroes, players become everyday heroes in the very place where we feel most vulnerable: the world's airports.  Terrible engine fires, a hell of flames in the passenger terminal, crashed helicopters or collapsed parts of buildings require the skilful use of fire engines, fire extinguishers and special tools.  Players expect dramatic situations - every mission counts! Lives must be saved!\n\n\u2022 Countless exciting missions in the airport area\n\u2022 Pure realism due to the control of large fire engines and their use during the extinguishing process\n\u2022 Many different locations: Planes, terminals, offices...\n\u2022 Numerous different fire engines to choose from\n\u2022 Various challenging levels of difficulty",
