	"description": "Ramto isn\u2019t the smartest guy in the Universe. He enjoys finding troubles - and solving them, but when woke up on a spaceship it was too much even for him. Alone on the ship he had no idea how to pilot, among heaps of weird devices created by a schizophrenic engineer.\n\nTardy is a quest about fiddling with computers, terminals gadgets and other hi-tech scrap of all sorts. Deal with crazy machines, solve the mystery of the crew disappearance and help Ramto to come back home!\n\n-Do you like conspiracy theories? Start making them up then! The crew is gone, the ship seems to hate you, the Galaxy is engulfed by war and is teeming with traitors.\n-Feel carsick wearing VR-glasses? You won\u2019t need them to immerse into the game. All the buttons, switches and terminals are as good as real.\n-Enjoy playing quests but tired of find-the-item and run-around-the-location things? If you don\u2019t want to combine banana peel to a hammer in your inventory, Tardy is the game you\u2019ve been looking for! \n-Pixel art still doesn\u2019t make you cry blood? Wonderful! Moreover, ours is pleasing to the eye. Just like our music is pleasing to the ear.\n",
