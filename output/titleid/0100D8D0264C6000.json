	"description": "CloverPit Gamble is a hellish fusion of card madness and deadly roulette. A rogue-lite where you\u2019ve built your own prison and are now doomed to rot inside it. Chained in a damp iron cell, face-to-face with a trembling slot machine and a greedy ATM, you must pay your debt after every round\u2026 or be consumed entirely and dragged into the endless pit of debt.\n\nSurvival here means twisting luck to your will. Spin the reels of the slot machine, squeezing out the last coins. Bend trophies and charms to your advantage, tearing the rules apart and forging devastating chains of combinations. Play dirty, break the system, feed your captor\u2014until the moment comes when you might escape this rotten trap.\n\nKey Features:\n- A ruthless rogue-lite where each round could be your final breath.\n- Progression system, multiple endings, and hidden rewards for those who endure.\n- Endless Mode: try to beat your own records while the chamber gnaws away at your sanity.\n- The atmosphere of a rusted chamber turned into a hellish puzzle box.\n- A grim tale of addiction, debt, and the futility of escape.\n\nBut remember \u2014 in CloverPit Gamble, every spin is a deal with the devil, and every victory only brings you closer to the next fall. The question isn\u2019t if you\u2019ll lose\u2026 it\u2019s how deep you\u2019ll sink before the pit swallows you whole.",
