	"description": "We present \"Help me, doctor,\" the game in which the player takes a role of a doctor. His job is to diagnose patients and this is not as easy as it might seem. First of all, our doctor must always be careful with the documenation, signatures etc. Throughout the game he is carefully monitored by the crooked Ministry of Health.\nWhen there is a patient in front of our desk, he mentions three symptoms of the many diseases. Rubber teeth, nicely smelling farts, soap bubbles coming out of nose? The player is put with the task to associate these symptoms to a particular disease. Do you bet on quality? Carefully looking at each patient, or the quantity, to earn as much cash as you can.\nOh... and here we have come to the point.\nWill you accept a bribe? Will you let a VIP patient come first?\nYou'll decide what kind of doctor you'll become. What will you do, when a patient come and say: Help me, doctor!",
