Embark on a dramatic real-time tactical adventure.\n\nIn this world, opposites intertwine\u2014 cuteness and grotesqueness, hope and despair, life and death.\n\nThose who yearn for death, yet cannot bring themselves to it, arrive at the Interworld suspended between life and death.\n\nThis is the story of Mitsu Mao, a girl clinging to life who gets lost in this Interworld, and those she meets there who have desired death.\n\nThe game consists of an adventure part, where you explore the Interworld, and a real-time tactical part, where you strategically defeat the monsters blocking Mao's path with her allies.\nEmbark on a dramatic real-time tactical adventure.",
