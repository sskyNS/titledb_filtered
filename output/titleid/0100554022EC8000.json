	"intro": "Being the Lord of Hell is hard. One minute you're judging souls, the next you're speed-dating devils and writing love poems to angels.",
	"description": "You are the Lord of Hell, tasked with judging mortals who arrive for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes, you even have the power to resurrect certain individuals\u2014changing the course of fate itself.\n\nA variety of devilish girls each control unique resources in the underworld. To gain their support, you'll need to build strong relationships with them. Go on dates, get married, play cards, chat... and of course, enjoy all sorts of interactive minigames together to deepen your bond.\n\nHeaven may be your enemy, but its angels don't all seem hostile. Try dining with them, giving gifts, and having heart-to-heart conversations... Can you date an angel too?",
