Check out brand new characters, new events, secret endings and countless other ways to explore the (after)life of a love-struck high school monster! \n\nCompetitive dating sim\nNothing makes the heart grow fonder than a little competition. Set your gaze on one of the sweethearts, but if you share your romantic tastes with your friends, be ready for some stiff competition.\n\nCouch Multiplayer for one-to-four people\nPlay by yourself, with a significant other or with your favourite group of friends.\n\nEasy to pick up and play\nNo learning required, just have your heart strings ready for tugging.\n\nHundreds of events & unique items\nRise to the top of the high-school popularity food chain by taking part in hundreds of events that branch out into situations with 1000+ multiple outcomes.

Through whimsical, postmodern humor, written by Cory O\u2019Brien, Maggie Herskowitz and Juli\u00e1n Quijano, there is no topic Monster Prom won\u2019t make fun of, including itself.\n\nGorgeous art\nThere\u2019s never a dull moment while exploring the beautifully crafted world and characters drawn by Arthur Tien.\n\nFreedom of choice\nIn Monster Prom the game experience is unaffected by gender or sexual orientation, since finding love is already hard enough.",
