	"description": "Sunshower is a colorful, casual arcade action game that follows a robot's survival in a rain storm! Use the plant installed on your head to reach for the sky as you achieve high scores and stop the rain from washing away the world. Enjoy a transforming, traditionally illustrated watercolor background and fun new music that appear as you gain more points. And, as you play more, find out what the robot you're controlling, Hinata, thinks of your time playing together.\n\nCollect, combine, and chain power-ups to stop the rainfall! Gain more strength to carry more drops, increase your speed, or use an umbrella to deflect one drop. Every playthrough is unique!\n\nUnlock an alternate, more challenging single player mode! You can also find 8 different customization options for Hinata! Try local co-op to reach for your highest score with a friend or compete to see who comes out on top!",
