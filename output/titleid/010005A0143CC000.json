However, since 2000, various non-governmental terrorist groups have been formed. In 2030, the ISS, the largest terrorist organization united all terrorist groups around the world and started to dominate cities. The ISS has become the most threatening terrorist organization in the world. At that time, new energy source was discovered that could change the future of humankind. The United Nations and NASA have sent a research team to investigate the new energy source. The ISS knew the value of the new energy source, terrorized major cities and occupied the energy source. From that time on, unexplained incidents such as network shutdowns, infectious diseases, mysterious deaths and mysterious aircraft crashes began to occur all over the world. The United Nations has concluded that these incidents are related to newly discovered energy source. The United Nations has formed Counter Recon Special Force with competent veterans to stop terrorism. The mission of the Counter Recon Special Force is to rescue researchers detained in each city and retrieve the energy source occupied by the ISS.",
