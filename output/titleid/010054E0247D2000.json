	"description": "After you inherit a small apartment from your late father, a mysterious man appears.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Yokai hiding among your tenants.\u201d\nAnd that Yokai cannot lie.\nFrom subtle Suspicious at the edges of their words to events that don\u2019t add up,\nyou\u2019ll tug on every loose thread as your life as a landlord-detective begins.\n\n<Overview>\nPlay from the landlord\u2019s perspective and identify the Yokai that cannot lie, then present your evidence, persuade them, and evict them in this Werewolf-style social deduction adventure. The story unfolds across multiple chapters. As each chapter passes, the seasons change, and with every eviction new tenants\u2014and new Yokai\u2014move in, reshaping the web of relationships. In every chapter your goal is to deduce who the Yokai is and protect your beloved apartment from them.\n Why do Yokai gather in your building? And what is the true intent of the mysterious man who warned you? Those mysteries lie at the heart of the story for you to uncover.\n\nIn a world where connections feel thinner than ever, conversations with your tenants gradually build trust.\nBeyond simple puzzle-solving, a quiet, heartwarming tale of growth and understanding awaits you.\n\n<Talking with the Tenants>\nAt first, no one really trusts the landlord. Take notes on everyday chats, complaints, and idle small talk, and look for Suspicious you can follow up on. Only the Yokai cannot lie\u2014so somewhere, a seam will show.\n\n<Proof and Eviction>\nSaying \u201cYou\u2019re suspicious\u201d won\u2019t make anyone move out. Gather proof that the other tenants are human and line up your Suspicious clues to box the culprit in with logic until they confess. Evicting a human by mistake only breeds distrust among those who remain \u2014 exactly what the Yokai wants.\n\n<Time\u2019s Up>\nOn the new moon of Week 5, the Yokai reveals its true power.\nIf you haven\u2019t evicted them by then, there\u2019s nothing a human can do.\nMake every day count \u2014 observe, follow the Suspicious, deduce, and close in before time runs out.",
