You will have to use that meager income to buy upgrades, equipment, and hire coworkers.\n\nThe enemies only grow stronger by each passing day, and you never know when they might eventually overpower you.\n\nEvery morning, you can buy one card out of three choices. There are over 70 cards, including weapons, coworkers, upgrades, and random chance events.

Fight together with your coworkers and build up your trust, and you'll unlock stories with each of them.\n\nEndure and survive the endless invasion, and find out what lies at the end of these girls' gruelling battle.\n\nTest your limits with the difficult Challenge Mode!\n- Play as characters you meet in Main Mode\n- Use exciting new cards exclusive to Challenge Mode!\n- Watch special events by finding the right character combinations\n- Compete against other players around the world to see who can survive the longest\n\nNote: The console version comes with the artbook included.",
