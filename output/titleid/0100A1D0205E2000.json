	"description": "ICE PELLETS AND SNOWBALLS\nThe legendary Snow Bros. series began over 30 years ago. Snow Bros. Wonderland is the newest chapter\u2014and boy, has a lot changed in the last couple of decades! For starters, the graphics aren\u2019t two-dimensional anymore; the new game offers a gorgeous 3D isometric style. Armed with an endless supply of ice pellets, gamers can turn monsters into snowballs, which can be kicked to destroy whole hordes of foes! Attacks can be chained to take down multiple enemies at once, and your snowball skills will be put to the ultimate test against some truly massive bosses. Are you (snow)man enough to defend Snow Land from evil King Atchich?\n\nFOUR TIMES THE FUN\nPreviously, Snow Bros. was always a two-player game (which makes perfect sense given the name), but this time, the number of players has doubled! Now, you can have up to four players at once, making the adventure even more fun to experience. After all, shared joy is double the joy, and quadrupled joy is even better! Oh, and did you know that you can also customize your snowy avatar with hats, goggles, scarves, and all kinds of fun stuff? Find your own style!\n\nTHE HISTORY OF SNOW BROS\nThe first game in the chilly, snowy Snow Bros. saga was released in 1990, featuring two snowman brothers, Nick and Tom, who rolled snowballs, jumped on platforms, and defeated enemies in a quest to rescue the princesses Puripuri and Puchipuchi. Four years later, the sequel, Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves\u2014a game as quirky and bizarre as it was wonderfully entertaining\u2014was released. But despite the love for the first two Snow Bros. games, we haven\u2019t had a true third entry in the series. Until now.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Let\u2019s grab some friends and dive into the snowy fun!",
