	"description": "Your daughter is missing. The world is gone. Only the Mist remains.\nIn Mist, a devastating crash marks the beginning of your descent into a world lost to alien terror. As a father, you search desperately for your child\u2014but what you find instead is a crumbling world buried in fog, crawling with monsters beyond comprehension.\nThis is no ordinary RPG. Mist fuses idle progression, visceral real-time combat, and an evolving horror narrative into a genre-defying experience. As you explore the ruins of civilization, you\u2019ll form a pact with a mysterious alien being that grants you strength\u2014at a cost. Level up, mutate, and unlock terrifying new abilities as you battle grotesque creatures and uncover long-buried truths.\nBut the world isn\u2019t empty. Survivors remain\u2014scarred, strange, and not always trustworthy. Your decisions in branching dialogue shape who lives, who dies, and what kind of person you become. Upgrade your idle harvesting machines, forge new weapons, and evolve into something far greater\u2026 or far more monstrous.\nWith each step, you draw closer to your daughter\u2014and deeper into the Mist. Eight haunting regions await, filled with side quests, riddles, powerful enemies, and moral dilemmas. Can you hold on to your humanity when everything else is lost?\nMist is a bold mix of action, survival, and storytelling in a world where hope flickers like a dying light. Step into the fog\u2014and face what waits within.",
