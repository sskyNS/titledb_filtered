	"description": "The FRAMED Collection is a new compilation of the critically-acclaimed, multi-award winning noir puzzle games FRAMED and FRAMED 2.\n\nRearrange the panels of an animated comic book to craft the story of a noir-styled spy adventure. Presented in an extensive series of visual puzzles, requiring logic and imagination, each panel move changes the current narrative, leading to all kinds of comedic blunders, untimely deaths, and--when solved correctly--stylish heists, fast getaways and nail-biting escapades.\n\nThe FRAMED Collection for Switch includes a completely updated UI, but retains the intuitive tactile controls of FRAMED and FRAMED 2. Perfectly suited for the portable play that the Switch is renowned for, the puzzle format of the FRAMED Collection can turn a quick train trip into a pleasurable escape, or a night away on holiday into an adventure.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe Complete FRAMED experience\nThe FRAMED Collection is a new compilation of the award-winning, noir puzzle games FRAMED and FRAMED 2. Escape effortlessly into the stylish, pulp-noir spy world of FRAMED, before delving deeper with the more challenging prequel FRAMED 2.\n\nSimple, but uniquely clever puzzle design\nSelect animated comic panels and move them around using your logic skills and your imagination to craft the best outcome. Getting the story \u2018wrong\u2019 is as much part of the experience as getting it \u2018right\u2019, with every rearrangement telling a different, satisfying--and sometimes very comedic--story.\n\nHand-crafted noir art and animation\nFrom the first frame to the last, the FRAMED collection oozes with stylish, noir, award-winning art and animation. Unique, hand-drawn silhouetted characters, incredibly fluid animations, and beautiful, mysterious settings all bring the FRAMED world to life with a wink of mischievous personality.\n\nMulti-award winning, genre-bending design\nFRAMED Collection features a fusion of unique game mechanics and clever narrative puzzles that bend genres and constantly deliver a satisfying experience with every panel arrangement. A winner of multiple game awards, and a finalist of IGF 2015\u2019s \u2018Excellence in Design\u2019 Award, Hideo Kojima named FRAMED his Game of the Year in 2014--\u201cwithout any doubt\u201d.\n\nAn all-original live jazz soundtrack\nFeaturing live jazz performances fused with modern themes and funky beats, the soundtracks to FRAMED and FRAMED 2 are as mesmerising as they are evocative, setting the mood and upping the mystery-laden tension.",
