	"description": "In this game you abstractly follow the narration of a young man who slowly but surely becomes insane. \nThis leads you straight into the middle of an exciting murder case and a murder mystery unfolds while you listen to the testimonies of witness, friends and relatives.\nThe whole game is somewhat Christmas flavored - however, don't get yourself comfortable, the game not going to give you a nice and warm feeling but rather confront you with a cold and harsh reality as the thrilling storytelling of the game will leave you with a cold shiver down your spine.\n\nThe game is a must have for any true fan of thrillers and anyone how enjoys a murder mystery that goes beyond the normal story telling. \n\n\nHow does the gameplay work?\n\nYou will play as a free-floating ghost like creature. \nBasically, as the soul of someone who is experiencing the story. \nYou are very small in comparison to the surroundings and can fly freely through the area. \nYou start by exploring the area and enjoying the feeling of flying as well as the gentle yet mysterious background music. \n\nSoon after starting to explore, you will find the first memory piece. \nYou can collect the memory pieces to continue with the story and to advance with the overall narration. \nThe story talks about a young boy, about his live and about how everything changes. It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. \n\nThe first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become. \nOnce you have finished a chapter by collecting all memory pieces and finishing the overall story of a level you will continue into the next chapter.",
