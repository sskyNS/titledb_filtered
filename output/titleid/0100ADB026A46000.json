Reach the finish line safely and prove your courage!\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpieces that built a generation for video games.\n\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
