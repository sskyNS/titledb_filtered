	"description": "In Everwarder there's you, and a procedurally-generated world covered in darkness. Touch it - and it will spawn a creature that will try to destroy your most precious thing \u2013 a crystal with your friend trapped inside. \n\nTOWER DEFENSE LIKE NO OTHER \nEvery run starts with your crystal and a supply of energy. Then it's up to you how to fight the darkness. Do you steadily expand, clearing the darkness, harvesting its energy, and carefully deploying defenders to deal with whatever emerges from the dark? Or do you play it fast and loose, striking out to locate ancient structures and powerful artifacts hidden within? \n\nEVOLVE AND ADAPT \nFailure is just another word for learning. With every run you gather minerals and unlock new options on the upgrade tree, allowing you to become stronger and last longer against the darkness. After all, time is not on your side: Enemies grow stronger as the seconds tick on - but so do you, gathering new resources, boosts, and upgrading your defenders to last just a bit longer. \n\nENDLESS CHALLENGE \nEvery run is randomly generated, with its own set of challenges and twists that will keep you on your toes. Every upgrade tweaks the experience, creating various synergies. So even if you struggle to keep up with the pressure, there\u2019s always a way to turn the tides of the battle!",
