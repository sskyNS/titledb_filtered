	"description": "Not for the faint of heart, Bot Gaiden is all action, execution and speed! Ninja robots Robyu and Bytron race to recover the power skulls that have been stolen by each of Giorqio's 6 Hench-bots. Slicing everything in their path, they must reach their destination quickly. The Hench-bots grow stronger with time and exposure to the skulls. The faster you go, the easier the fight! However, going faster means putting yourself in harm's way and trying to figure out the most efficient path through each stage.\n\nBot Gaiden is designed to be a shared experience, no matter what the skill mismatch might be. Got a child that's just learning? Team up. Got a buddy that just stinks at action games? Bring 'em on! You can teleport to your partner at any time. Lagging players can instantly catch up, and experienced players can lend a helping hand, instantly.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Run, jump and slash through challenging hand-crafted stages!\n\u2022 Choose between casual, normal, hardcore and ludicrous difficulty settings.\n\u2022 Defeat bosses to earn their rewards in any order!\n\u2022 Team up for fast-paced local cooperative action.\n\u2022 Discover unlockables in an addictive gameplay cycle.\n\u2022 Earn gold rewards to survive the endgame gauntlet!",
