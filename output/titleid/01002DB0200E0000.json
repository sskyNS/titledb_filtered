	"description": "\"Q2 HUMANITY\" is a completely new sequel to the \"Q\" series.\n\nIn the previous \"Q\" series, players cleared levels by using what they drew in a very simple physics-based puzzle game.\nHowever, \"Q2 HUMANITY\" is a game where you not only \"draw\", but also utilize \"character abilities\" to tackle over 300 stages.\nIn addition to basic abilities like jumping, grabbing, throwing, and punching, there are characters who excel at throwing, can double jump, set off bombs, and even manipulate gravity, with a total of 18 characters each possessing unique special abilities.\n\nWhat happens when characters with different special abilities come together?\nWhat if characters with the same special ability come together?\n\nThe possibilities to solving these puzzles are limitless!\nWill you cooperate to clear the tough stages...or rather hinder each other...?\n\n\"Q2 HUMANITY\" supports both local and online multiplayer, allowing up to four players to join in.\nOf course, you can also challenge it solo.\n\nWith no single correct answer, you can enjoy it multiple times with various approaches.\nExperience both \"the satisfaction of solo play\" and \"the fun of cooperative multiplayer\" in this exceptionally versatile game.\nPlease enjoy it to the fullest!",
