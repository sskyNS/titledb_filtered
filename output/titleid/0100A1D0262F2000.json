	"intro": "A peculiar shooting game featuring the exploits of Carbuncle. Fight enemies, collect apples, and battle bosses to clear the stages!",
	"description": "This title is a unique shooting game that was included in \"Disk Station #25,\" released by Compile in 1991. Players control Carbuncle to collect falling apples, and the stage is cleared once they defeat the boss that appears at the end.\n\nThe game takes place on stages themed around a giant tree, where you use jumps and shots to fight enemies. Apples grow on the tree within the stage and fall over time, which you must catch and collect. When the TIME gauge on the left side of the screen runs out, a Pelican holding a basket appears. Throwing the collected apples into the Pelican's basket opens the window in the center of the screen, revealing the boss. Victory in the intense battle with the boss allows you to proceed to the next stage.\n\nIn addition to shooting down enemies, this game features unique mechanics like collecting apples and using the Pelican to summon the boss. This title is highly recommended for anyone who wants to try a slightly different kind of shooting game, as well as for Carbuncle fans.",
