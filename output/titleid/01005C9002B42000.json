	"description": "\"SAMURAI SHODOWN\" is a fighting game that was originally released by SNK in 1993. \n\nThe game features 12 swordmasters, each with their own unique personality. They will battle it out among each other before taking on Shiro Tokisada Amakusa in the game's climax. One of the unique characteristics of this game is the Rage Gauge which fills up as the player takes damage. Once that gauge is full the character's attacks do more damage, keeping the battles tense and exciting.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\n\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\n\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",
