	"description": "Akane is a brutal arena arcade slasher based on one-hit-one-kill gameplay mechanics where you will:\n\nFace five types of opponents:\n\n\u25cf Yakuza Guy - a common mafia pawn;\n\u25cf Tank - this is the only villain that will require more than just one katana slash to die;\n\u25cf Shooter - a sharpshooter with cybernetic enhancements. Pro tip: they never miss;\n\u25cf Cyber Ninja - a warrior who abdicated his body to become a killing machine. His dash attacks are deadly and his defense seems impenetrable. Remember however that everybody has their weak point;\n\u25cf The Boss - Katsuro, your Nemesis who evolves, gets stronger and more dangerous according to the number of times he gets killed.\n\nComplete missions to unlock new guns and equipment:\n\n\u25cf Different pistols;\n\u25cf Katanas, each with their own unique unique abilities;\n\u25cf Cigarettes that change the aesthetics of your special skills;\n\u25cf Gadgets that grant small but significant improvements in combat;\n\u25cf Boots that change the dash and the way you move on the screen.\n\nMake a good use of your special Samurai Skills:\n\n\u25cf Dragon Slash - dash forward killing every enemy on your way;\n\u25cf Dragon Slayer - kill all enemies on the screen.",
