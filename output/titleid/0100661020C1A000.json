	"description": "As a member of the counter terrorist Spy Drops team, you are tasked with neutralizing a threat that could plunge the world into digital darkness, while you unknowingly get tangled in a deeper conspiracy.\n\nDropped behind enemy lines, your covert ops are to infiltrate infrastructure and undertake secret ops. While onsite you also need to make use of the Dream Catcher to extract intel from the minds of soldiers to discover the location of the next targets.\n\nMissions are randomly generated producing a tense gameplay experience as you never know what is around the next corner. Everyone's game will be different.\n\nYou'll explore enemy bases room-by-room, choosing how to tackle each one, navigating past enemies who can see your shadow and hear your footsteps. You can dodge, hack or shoot cameras, sneak past or knock out guards, scout the area with a drone, hide in lockers, or even wear sponge boots to move around quieter. \n\nYou're free to choose which equipment to take on each mission, choosing from drones, hacking devices, explosives, night vision googles and many more. Varying times of day and weather conditions can be a hindrance or provide cover, so you'll need to equip accordingly. New equipment and weapons become available as the game progresses.\n\nTake on a friend in local head-to-head multiplayer with Spy against Spy!\n\n\n",
