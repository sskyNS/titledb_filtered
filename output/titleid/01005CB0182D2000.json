	"description": "ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE\nNadir is a grimdark deck-building rogue-like adventure, with artwork burning of infernal fire and extraordinary inspirations straight from Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. Command an avatar of one of the Deadly Sins in 1v1 fights against powerful demons.\n\nDOUBLE CARDS\nEngage in card battles where each of your cards can be played in two ways, depending on its color: blue or red. Balance between them to your advantage, but be careful, as your every action charges the abilities of the enemy.\n\nCARDS CRAFTING\nCollect red and blue abilities on your journey and combine them into unique double cards, shaping the deck in your own way to prepare for upcoming challenges and survive as long as possible.\n\nEXPAND YOUR CITY\nGather resources during expeditions to expand the city of Nadir and unlock new characters, cards, and vendors. Develop your underworld kingdom and increase your chances in future fights until you can beat the boss and unlock new Sins.\n\nDEADLY SINS\nEach of the Sins brings their own set of enemies that greatly alter your gamestyle. Learning it and developing a strategy to beat it is the key to building a powerful deck and surviving each fight.",
