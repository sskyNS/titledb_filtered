However, during the event 'KING OF CATS' held every five years, invasion of other areas is allowed.'\n\nAnd it stated, 'Instead of violent conflicts, fighting in a \"game\" called \"KING OF CATS\" is to take place.'\nThis is the story until this city \"collapses.\"\n\n\u25bcPlay Modes\nIn addition to Story Mode and Battle Mode, League Mode is also available.
