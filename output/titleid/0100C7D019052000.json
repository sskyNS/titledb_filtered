	"description": "\"The Ward\" is the second installment in the 9 Clues series, in which a young detective and her partner respond to a distress call from a psychiatric hospital on a secluded island.\nThe island is isolated by freezing waters and constant, brutal storms. Upon the detectives\u2019 arrival, one of the hospital\u2019s therapists falls out of the window to his death.\nAs their investigation begins, the detectives learn much darker things are happening at Mnemosyne Asylum than they could have guessed. None of the patients are willing to speak about the devastating fire that engulfed the hospital four years ago, or the fire\u2019s victims. The staff do everything they can to obscure the asylum\u2019s past, and keep the fa\u00e7ade of peace and order intact.\n\nEach new clue only raises more questions. Who killed Doctor Crow? What drove one of the male nurses insane? Who is Zed Rascov? Why is the name of a little girl, Ginger, carved into the wood-paneled wall of the dead doctor\u2019s office?",
