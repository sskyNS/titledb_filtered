Let's aim for a faster time.\nYou can challenge a total of 36 courses, 18 Fixed courses and 18 Random courses.\n\nIn Puzzle mode, you can make numbers without any time limit. You use only 0-9 and 0.1-0.9 and make numbers by using the four arithmetic operations and so on.\nThere are two modes in Puzzle mode, \"Step by step\" where the number increases by 1, and \"Jump up\" where the number increases randomly.\n\n\nIn Battle mode, you can battle against each other.\n\nRules of the Battle\n1.
