	"description": "This original adventure game explores a love story between two beautiful souls through ingenious humour and a bizarre, hand-drawn, frame-by-frame animation style. Our hero\u2019s beloved has been abducted by evil spirits, and the only way to reunite them is to reincarnate himself as a dragon to defeat Evil. But something has gone wrong, and his soul is reborn as a worm named Pip. Now Pip must overcome the challenges of a surreal world, solve mind bending puzzles, and save his love. Choosing between good and evil, Pip learns the laws of Karma, and his choices define the outcome of the game.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2014 Play as Pip and explore a rich, bizarre world.\n\u2014 Use Astral sight, a power that allows you to peek into the world of spirits at any point of the game.\n\u2014 Learn Karma laws through choice and action. Each evil deed spoils Pip\u2019s karma and changes his appearance. Good deeds purify karma. Key characters respond differently to Pip\u2019s karma, opening additional storyline.\n\u2014 Hand-drawn animations of the varied interactions of Pip with his strange environment. The environment and other characters of the quests are drawn individually for each situation.\n\u2014 Live magical award winning music and sound by ZMEIRADUGA.",
