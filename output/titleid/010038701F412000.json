Developed by the Brazilian studio Ilex Games, players take control of the Solar Champion, a long-dead Plutonian resurrected by the primordial light of the Sun. Tasked with reactivating a mysterious interdimensional fortress, the Champion must restore balance to the multiverse. \n\nAs players battle through a series of diverse, interconnected biomes and confront brutal mutant bosses, they will unlock new abilities and enhancements \u2013 each revealing deeper layers of the game\u2019s enigmatic, cosmic narrative. The game lives in the spiritual landscape of the original Adventure, brimming with its core elements of exploration, curiosity, and hidden secrets. Not a remake or sequel, Adventure of Samsara instead asks players to search for subtle references to the very first adventure game as they journey through a remarkably deep world.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Metroidvania Exploration: Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.\n\n- Classic Gameplay Feel: With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, Adventure of Samsara evokes a timeless feel while offering something entirely new.\n\n- Original Worldbuilding: Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.\n\n- Easter Eggs: Discover nods to the original Adventure, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.\n\n- Collectible Items: Find hidden items, cached away in hard-to-reach corners, to improve your stats and load augments to enhance your abilities and skills.",
