Make meaningful connections with completely random players online as they are all striving alongside you to earn the most precious resource of all: Karma.\n\nA NEVER-ENDING CHALLENGE\nThe Loop is where you\u2019ll join a team of up to 10 random players around the world. Together, you\u2019ll tackle a series of increasingly challenging levels that adapt to the size of your team, the characters you play and the perks you pick together. No two runs are quite the same when the players and the game itself are changing!\n\nTHE POWER OF KARMA\nDoing good earns Karma! Stick together, use your character\u2019s strengths, and even sacrifice yourself because helping one another is essential in the Loop\u2019s deadly challenges. Every good thing you do, one way or another, earns you the sweet Karma you\u2019ll use to unlock new characters and abilities for future Loops.\n\nLOCAL MULTIPLAYER\nWelcoming friends or family at home?
