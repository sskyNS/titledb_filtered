	"intro": "Darkness came over the magical kingdom. The most powerful wizards stood against evil forces. But the enemy was too strong. The battle was lost.",
	"description": "Is magical kingdom doomed, having only Wizard Mike as its protector? Yes. Most likely.\n\nBut there\u2019s a chance, small one but still \u2013 Mike might not be the smartest guy in the room. Maybe he failed alchemy classes 17 times in a row. Maybe he almost destroyed the entire University of Magic causing an explosion during the potions class. But he doesn\u2019t lack self-confidence! He just needs your help. Guide him through the battle with evil forces and save the kingdom!\n\n\nWizard Mike is an insanely addictive logic game.\n\n- Avoid traps set by your enemies\n\n- Use all your brainpower to solve puzzles\n\n- Use your magic wand to get rid of the enemies!\n\n\nBut the enemies aren\u2019t stupid (they only look like that) and they defend themselves as much as they can \u2013 you must use your brain and also logic to pass all levels of this cool adventure game. On your way, you will run into various obstacles \u2013 bombs, traps or even\u2026 knights \u2013 but remember that every weapon can be a double-edged sword.\n\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you are not alone in this war \u2013 you have your brave wand at your service, which can turn your opponents into dust. In some levels, you will appreciate your Magic Potion Travel Kit.\n\n\nMike is still a teenager so he cares about his look and fashion style \u2013 you have a ton of clothes, hats and even wings to change style of your cool wizard to even cooler wee-zharrd. This could help you to shock your opponents even before the battle!",
