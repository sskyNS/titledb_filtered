	"description": "Takumi Sumino is a totally average teenager living in the Tokyo Residential Complex, a place where every day is much like the last and nothing bad ever happens. All that changes when freakish monsters attack the town and start wreaking havoc. A strange creature calling itself Sirei appears and offers Takumi the power to protect those he holds dear... All he has to do is stab himself in the chest!\n\nThe next thing he knows, Takumi is in Last Defense Academy, a colossal school in the middle of nowhere surrounded by a wall of otherworldly flames. He and 14 other students have been drafted into the Special Defense Unit, a team tasked with keeping the school safe for the next 100 days. Initiated students transform their blood into the mysterious Hemoanima, a unique type of mutated blood which provides supernatural abilities. How much are they willing to sacrifice to take back their normal lives and save the world from the grotesque school invaders? The curtain rises on 100 days of war and despair...\n\nExtreme Despair-Filled Endings\nTakumi's choices will decide his future, but there's no telling what kinds of consequences these decisions might have...\n\nDefensive Battles\nWhen the invaders attack, it's up to Takumi to protect the school in tactical RPG battles. Use each student's unique Specialist Skills to turn the tide of battle in his favor!\n\nFree Time & Exploration\nSpend time with Takumi\u2019s teammates to deepen his bonds with them, or explore the wilderness and ruins outside the school. Players can even use the items found to craft gifts and get even closer to Takumi\u2019s allies!",
