	"description": "Unmatched: Digital Edition is an adaptation of the critically acclaimed board game, where two (or more) opponents command characters from myth, history, or fiction in a battle for the ages! Have you ever wondered who would win, King Arthur (aided by Merlin) or a sword-wielding Alice of Wonderland? How would Sinbad and his trusty porter fare against Medusa and the three harpies? The only way to find the truth is in battle with a quick game of Unmatched!\n\nIn Battle The Are No Equals!\n\nWhat is Unmatched?\nUnmatched: Digital Edition is a tactical game where each player commands their hero and sidekick(s), using a unique deck of cards, to defeat their opponent on the field of battle.\n\nThe rules are simple. On your turn, take two actions which can be:\n- Maneuver: Move your fighters and draw a card!\n- Attack: Play an attack card!\n- Scheme: Play a scheme card (cards that have a special effect).\n\nGet your opponent's hero to zero health, and you win the game.\n\nWhat makes the game special is that each hero has a unique deck and ability. Alice grows big and gets small. King Arthur can discard a card to power up his attack. Sinbad gets stronger as he goes on more voyages. Medusa can damage you with just a glance.\n\nWhat makes Unmatched great?\nUnmatched is one of those easy-to-learn games with an incredible amount of depth. The tactical insight and knowledge of your hero and your opponents will determine the outcome of the fight. Games are quick \u2013 but play out very differently! Your decisions will determine your fate, and your skill (and just a bit of luck) will win the day.\n\nWhat can you expect?\n* Epic duels between the most unlikely opponents!\n* Huge tactical depth!\n* Stunning artwork by legendary artists!\n*Three levels of AI for solo play!\n* Near infinite replayability!\n* Easy to learn, hard to master!\n* In-game tutorial and rulebook!\n* Online multiplayer!\n* Synchronous and asynchronous game modes!\n* Official Unmatched rules consulted with the designers of the board game!\n* Multiple expansions to come - bringing new heroes and maps!\n* Unique experience of a board game with the convenience of a digital platform!\n\nThe original board game was awarded the following honors:\n* 2019 Board Game Quest Awards Best Two Player Game Nominee\n* 2019 Board Game Quest Awards Best Tactical/Combat Game Nominee\n\nThe application was recognized by the BoardGameGeek community:\n* Best Board Game App Winner of the 18th Annual Golden Geek Awards for 2023",
