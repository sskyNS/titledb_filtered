	"description": "FART YOUR WAY TO VICTORY!\nAliens have busted into your backyard and kidnapped your friends and family. The only edge you have is you\u2019re a pig with a serious case of flatulence.\n\nTHEY ONCE LAUGHED...\nThe other pigs laugh at how smelly you are. They often call you \u2018Stinky\u2019. Stinky? Well\u2026 Who's laughing now? Too stinky for the aliens to take! You\u2019re now the only one who can save them before the dangerous starborn creatures steal all your friends away.\n\nAFTER THEM!\nUsing your powerful farts, rocket your way to victory! No alien craft can escape your fart filled might!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Precision platforming with a very musical gimmick! (Toot toot!)\n- Finally, a game with infinite double jumps! (Just don\u2019t light a match!)\n- Show them all they\u2019re wrong\u2026 (Prove your disability is a boon!)\nAt least two epic showdowns against the alien menace! (maybe even three?!)\n- The highest FPS (Farts Per Second) of any game ever released!\n\nONLY YOU CAN SAVE THEM...\nThere is no one else, just you, a bad case of IBS, and a family of fellow swine to save. Bounce, fart, jump, and explore your way up into the very stratosphere to rescue your friends from the clutches of their alien kidnappers. Heroes come in small packages, but sometimes they have big smells.",
