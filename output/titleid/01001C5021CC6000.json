	"description": "Kypros, consisting of the continent of Zaius and the seven islands surrounding it, had long been a peaceful place under the rule of the royal family. However, the ancient seal was broken by Bido Klerant, a man desiring great power, and his subordinates, the Seven Beast Generals. As a result, the Dark God Emperor Daar was resurrected. Empowered by the evil god, Bido began to secretly move in order to control Kypros.\n\n\u201cBurai : J\u014dkan\u201d is an RPG released by Riverhill Soft in 1989 in Japan. It features eight brave heroes, including pirates, fortune-tellers, and the leader of the dragon clan, and follows their heroic adventures. With as many as eight protagonist-level characters, it can be hard to become emotionally invested, but the game starts before the heroes meet each other. In the early stages, you\u2019ll come to understand each hero\u2019s background and circumstances, ensuring that you\u2019ll grow attached to the characters.\n\nThe dramatic storyline they weave is one of the major attractions of the game. Another notable feature in the system is the \u201cAction\u201d command, which allows characters to improve their abilities even outside of battles, as well as the fact that each hero has weapon compatibility settings. Evaluating each hero\u2019s strengths and deciding how to develop them is an essential element in progressing through the game.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
