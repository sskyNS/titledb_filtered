	"description": "This is a role-playing game released in Japan by XTAL SOFT in 1985. After escaping the Mugen Realm in the previous title, the protagonist supposedly returned home but instead found themselves in Elder Einh, a different world. Thus, they must embark on another adventure to return.\n\nLike its predecessor, the game features top-down exploration and encounter-based, command battles. However, symbol-based enemy encounters now let players evade foes and progress.\n\nPlayers form parties of up to five, choosing from numerous professions (e.g., Hero, Brave, Noble, Sorcerer). Spells boast evocative names (e.g., \"Seal, Recede,\" \"Flame, Be My Sword,\" \"Phantom Reinforcements Arise\"), well-received by many.\n\nWhile the previous game allowed escape from the Mugen Realm via the Heart of Illusion, how does one escape Elder Einh (the world of \u201cII\u201d)? Acclaimed as a classic Japanese RPG, this is a must-play for fans of traditional JRPGs.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
