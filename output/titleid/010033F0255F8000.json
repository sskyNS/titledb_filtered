	"description": "Emoji Rampage \u2013 Origins throws you into a chaotic, rogue-like first-person shooter where emojis aren\u2019t just harmless faces \u2014 they\u2019re deadly enemies.\nStart each run by customizing your experience with unique modifiers: crank up the difficulty, make every emoji wear a ridiculous hat, or turn on bouncing mode for hilarious chaos. Then pick your unlocked arena \u2014 from The Bouncy Castle to Candy World or even outer space \u2014 each with its own hazards and interactive traps.\nArmed with only a pistol, you\u2019ll face waves of emojis that charge, dash, fly, shoot, shield themselves, explode, and overwhelm you with sheer numbers. Kill them, collect glowing experience orbs, and level up to choose from powerful upgrades. Will you improve your damage, speed, or reload time? Unlock stronger weapons? Or summon explosive chaos to wipe out swarms at once? Every decision shapes your survival run.\nAs the arena fills with bouncing, exploding, and bullet-spewing emojis, the game becomes a frantic dance of dodging, aiming, and managing your ammo while exploiting map hazards like explosive sweets or damaging zones to survive longer. The further you go, the crazier it gets \u2014 until you\u2019re finally overwhelmed. But every run earns progress, new arenas, and more chaos for your next rampage.\nDo you have what it takes to survive the emoji apocalypse?",
