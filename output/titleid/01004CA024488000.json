	"description": "Get ready to lose your mind (and maybe your voice) in Tralalero Tralala: Rage Bait \u2014 a brutally challenging 2D pixel art platformer starring an unusually emotional shark with a short fuse and a long jump. This game will make you go Tung Tung Tung Sahur.\n\nIn a world built to break you, you play as TralaleroTralala, a shark with a dream: to jump, survive, and not rage quit. Navigate an endless gauntlet of spike pits, collapsing platforms, troll traps, and gravity-defying jumps \u2014 all designed to test your patience, timing, and sanity.\n\nEvery level is a carefully crafted rage trap, blending retro visuals with precision mechanics. The only way forward is up in this Tralalero Tralala game, but each fall sends you crashing back to the start... and deeper into sharky madness.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Tight, unforgiving platforming that rewards skill and timing.\n\n- Brutal level design with a side of dark humor.\n\n- Expressive pixel art that brings our sharky anti-hero to life (along with his meltdowns).\n\n- Original soundtrack that mockingly plays on while you fail.\n\n- No checkpoints. No mercy. All rage.\n\nCan you keep your cool, or will Tralalero Tralala lose it for you?",
