	"description": "The fate of the whole of mankind is in your hands. Are you brave enough to take on the mission?\n\nNew, action-packed, adrenaline-filled rogue-lite shooter to blast your mind of the planet is here!\n\nFrom the makers of legendary Drunk-Fu and Spareware, we\u2019re here to introduce to you the sequel of Spareware.\n\nBut wait. Wasn\u2019t Spareware quite... Quite...\n\n\u201cExtremely simple game with limited mechanics and highly repetitive play.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn ok shoot-em-up, no more no less.\u201d\n\n\u201cI quickly found myself becoming bored... the presentation of the game is relatively basic.\u201d\n\nAnd THAT\u2019S why it no longer even Spareware! Dear people and aliens, here comes Rogue Robots! Build up your annihilating robot and blast your way through the humanity that\u2019s destroying the wonderful planet of earth.\n\nYou\u2019ll be faced with waves of future police troops who are all trying to spill your oils off of the face of the earth. Your Rogue Robot will be dead, once it\u2019s dead and random maps will keep you entertained and mowing through the streets filled with enemies for hours and hours. \n\nRogue Robot\u2019s neat co-op mode with up to 4 teammates enables the fun and action with your friends locally or online.\n\nAnd then, what\u2019s left from Spareware? Well, the best parts:\n\n\u201cA bullet hell with customizable robots\u201d\n\n\u201cA solid wave shooter bringing roguelike permadeath and tactical decision making to the mix.\u201d\n\nCustomize your killing machine from different parts, which all affect differently for your abilities. Choose your weapons. Beware of the traps. Sweep through the enemies. Save humanity from itself.",
