	"description": "Together, they\u2019re the Freelance Police. And they\u2019re about to save the world.\n\nIn 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within.\n\nNow everyone\u2019s favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell.\n \nIt\u2019s just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the \u201cspinny thing\u201d they do with their eyes.)\n \nWho\u2019s the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam\u2019s nose for detective work, Max\u2019s lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max\u2019s street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds.\n\nReturn to the adventure game that was once called \u201cgaming\u2019s first sitcom\u201d and is today known as \u201cthe remaster you didn\u2019t know you were waiting for.\u201d With enhanced graphics, Joy-Con\u2122 and touch screen support, an original jazz score with five new tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN\u2019s Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that will be right at home in your Nintendo Switch\u2122 library.\n",
