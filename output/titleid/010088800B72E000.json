	"description": "Put your reflexes to the test and scratch your head with Pix the Cat!\n\nThis critically acclaimed intense arcade game is sure to leave you on the edge of your seat! Your mission is simple: collect all the ducklings and lead them to a safe zone! Easier said than done, though: if you\u2019re not careful enough, you\u2019ll end up crashing into those poor cuties before you know it!\nPlay against your own ghost, your friends\u2019, the master of the leaderboard\u2019s or even the developers\u2019 to push your limits even further and improve your skills in this all-out race to reach the highest score possible!\n\nFour different game modes available !\n\nArena: Joust against your friends! Collect as many eggs as possible to use them as ammo to blast your oppon- I mean, friends away! Only the most skilled player -or luckiest, we\u2019re not so sure- will be the last one standing! Up to four players can join the fun.\n\nArcade mode: Hatch as many ducklings as possible to always go deeper and deeper into the Grid of Infinity. Lead them to safe zones, watch out for walls and enemies, and get the highest score possible! But truth be told, your worst enemy here is yourself\u2026\n\nNostalgia mode: Tired of all that modern and neon-ish art? Let\u2019s dive into some good ol\u2019 30s atmosphere! Gather the number of ducklings required to finish each level! If you\u2019re quick enough, you\u2019ll get a bonus by getting them all before the goat can eat the flower! Yes, because there is a whole menagerie in this game.\n\nLaboratory: Solve the puzzles in as few moves as you can to get the best result! You won\u2019t be able to stop moving unless you hit a wall, so watch out where you\u2019re going!",
