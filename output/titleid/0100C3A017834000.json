	"description": "Prodeus is a first-person shooter of old, re-imagined using modern rendering techniques and technology. Experience the quality you\u2019d expect from a modern AAA game, designed with retro aesthetics and gameplay that invoke the tech-imposed limits of older hardware.\n\nThe game features a hand-crafted campaign from industry FPS veterans, co-op and competitive multiplayer play drawing on classic modes*, and a built-in community map browser for instantaneous action with nearly limitless levels to play.\n\nGet ready to paint the walls red. This is the Boomer Shooter you\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nRetro look, modern era\nShooters past and present collide with graphics that combine today\u2019s high-quality 3D tech with retro visuals. Experience over-the-top explosions of lo-fi pixels and hi-tech particle effects as you clash against the Prodeans and forces of Chaos.\n\nPure retro FPS chaos\nSteel yourself for fast and frantic nonstop action. Blast and blaze your way through hordes of chaos-spawned creatures using an arsenal of classically over-the-top weapons. \n\nRaining red\nSplatter the steel walls and alien halls with the blood of your enemies. Experience the gory thrills of the elder shooters, dialed up to 11 thanks to Prodeus\u2019s delightfully demented dismemberment system.\n\nCommunity-crafted levels\nDiscover new arenas through a built-in browser filled with community-created maps, and keep the visceral combat fresh.\n\nMultiplayer Mayhem\nTeam up and go head-to-head in a variety of multiplayer modes. Take on the campaign in 4-player co-op, and dive into the fray in 16-player Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, CTF, and more\u2014then take things to the next level by playing custom game modes.\n\nFrag to the Music\nBurst blood vessels listening to a supercharged metal soundtrack by retro FPS composer Andrew Hulshult that dynamically changes gears to accompany your actions.",
