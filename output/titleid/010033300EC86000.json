	"description": "Sea Salt is an action strategy hybrid, in which you are an Old God summoning unfathomable horrors to blight the human lands. You will have your sacrifice, and humanity will pay for denying you what you are owed.\nCommand an unruly troop of nightmarish creatures, cultists and horrors from the deep.\nControl the whole swarm at once, directing it to attack your victims or withdraw to avoid their defenses.\nUse the terrain to surprise and surround the weak minded to make them lose their minds to fear .\nDiscover cards in a hellish tarot to unlock over 16 different units with their own strengths and weaknesses.\nHunters, and special bosses alike, will be swept away on your path to vengeance.",
