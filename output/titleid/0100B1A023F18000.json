	"description": "A ruinous cataclysm unleashed by a tormented god descended the world of Talamhel into perpetual night. The hourglass of time was shattered and its essence poured across the land, creating an endless sea of sand. The once-flourishing world of Talamhel became a putrid lesion of its former glory and those who called it home are now husks of corruption--violent, undying, unyielding soldiers of death. \n\nBut Talamhel is not lost--not yet. \n\nFor generations, the righteous few have endured. You are one of those few. On the eve of your induction into the Order of Remnant Knights, the last protectors of man, Talamhel is once-again wracked by calamity. The corruptive nature of the Night Plague has mutated, and the realm of man needs the Remnant Knights more than ever. \n\nTrack down the emergent evil and destroy it. Protect the realm of man. \n\nFrom the helm of your nimble grainwake, carve across the perilous sandseas to confront the source of this newfound terror, but don\u2019t expect a guiding light or a red X on a map. You\u2019ll chart your own course forward--behold the open seas, and choose the heading you best see fit. \n\nBut familiarity is a far-flung concept aboard the grainwake--the shifting sands are always changing, revealing secrets, dangers, and paths unseen. Things are not as they seem\u2026 \n-Talamhel is an open world, free to explore and discover as you please. \n-Every island is a unique, colorful encounter of combat, lore, and plunder. \n-With tiered levels of difficulty, locations offer challenges that will reward those who overcome. \n-With a trusted (undead) companion rested in the crow\u2019s nest, you\u2019ll never sail the seas alone. \n\nThe corruption that plagues Talamhel has created a horde comprised of both man and other Talamhelic natives: The venerable Ferrum and the insectoid, hive-minded Hashara. Once warring nations have become an abominable army of undying malice. \n\nFrom doomsday cultists to fallen kings, the foes that guard the answers you seek are determined to see your end. Prepare for an unrelenting, unforgiving combat experience not to be taken lightly. Swing true, dear knight, swing true. \n\nWith hundreds of weapon components to be reclaimed from the crumbled remains of civilization, there are thousands of unique weapons to be forged. Find the hilt that fits just right. \n-Cleave through the corruption with 7 distinct fighting styles. \n-Bolster yourself with dozens of armor sets, each with their own unique defenses. \n-Combine and modify your devastation with magical augments, creating a personalized build.",
