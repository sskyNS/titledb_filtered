	"description": "This title is an action role-playing game originally included in Disc Station SP No. 2, released by Compile in 1989.\n\nThe game features a rather unique premise: the protagonist, Kelesis, sets out on a journey of culinary training (an adventure) to gain approval to marry a young lady. It covers all the classic elements expected of an action RPG from this era, including switching between top-down and side-scrolling views depending on the scene, as well as battling massive boss characters.\n\nNotably, this game is a parody of Shin Maou Golvellius (True Demon King Golvellius), so fans of that series should feel right at home. While the quirky presentation\u2014typical of Compile\u2014gives this title a lighter tone than the original, it remains a thoroughly enjoyable and solid action RPG.\n \n\n *The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n *Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
