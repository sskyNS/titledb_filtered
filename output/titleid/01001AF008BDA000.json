	"intro": "Wrap your way to bliss in Zen Bound 2, the unique down-tempo indie game! This is an opportunity to slow down, zone out, and focus on a task that\u2019s challenging but not stressful: a set of gentle spatial puzzles.\n\nThe goal of the game is to paint wooden sculptures by wrapping them with rope. You accomplish this by rotating the Joy-Con in your hands like it were the sculpture on the screen - a simple task with surprising complexity.\n\nZen Bound 2 is a calm and meditative gameplay experience, with tactile, dusty visuals and a sublime, enveloping soundtrack by the electronic artist \u2018Ghost Monkey\u2019.\n\nFEATURES:\n\u2022 Motion controlled gameplay\n\u2022 Over 100 levels\n\u2022 Achievements\n\u2022 Exclusive 5.1 surround soundtrack\n\u2022 Beautiful high definition visuals",
