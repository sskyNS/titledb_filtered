	"description": "Starlight Shores is an island-themed visual novel that adopts a unique \"\"short story\"\" romance style.\n\nIt features multiple endings where your choices truly matter.\n\nThe Story:\n\nAfter your childhood friend Theo wins a weekend getaway to the town of Seaside, you prepare to spend your birthday in paradise. It's been months since you last saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together.\n\nShe invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just the get-together that you need to reconnect. \n\nEverything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing along an uninvited guest.\n\nAlthough Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's about the only thing you share in common...\n\nWill you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?\n\nThe Cast:\n\nTheo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to have a tight-knit group and doesn't open up to just anyone. She studies photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is your host for the weekend.\n\nLena is Theo's roommate... and replacement best friend. You don't know much about her, or even what she's studying. From what you've seen on Friendex, Lena is a vibrant and outgoing person. She's always dyeing her hair different colours and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she enjoys hiking and playing piano.\n\nAlec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally, renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea... until he started dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been annoying you... more than usual.\n\nA year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown. You don't remember much about her, or ever talking to her...",
