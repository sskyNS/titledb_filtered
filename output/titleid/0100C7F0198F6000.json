	"intro": "Obsessed with occult rituals, you have finally obtained the last thing you need to summon the eldritch horror that has been haunting your dreams; a strange, bright-pink Necronomicon. You perform the only ritual that doesn\u2019t appear to be insane ramblings, and inadvertently summon Ln\u2019eta, a cute cthulhu-like girl. She agrees to a kiss, on the condition that you perform a few rituals from the book for her first. Looking back at the Necronomicon\u2026 all of the other pages suddenly make sense?\n\n\u25cf Three chapters of laughs, screams, and tears, all in one thick package!\n\u25cf Every decision you make will significantly affect gameplay and determine which ending you arrive at!\n\u25cf Immersive re-imagining of the visual novel genre loaded with gameplay!\n\u25cf \"Three\" \"fully-voiced\" \"dateable\" \"girls\"\n\u25cf A stylish artistic/musical direction reminiscent of old-school anime and dating sims!\n\u25cf No horror elements or danger whatsoever",
