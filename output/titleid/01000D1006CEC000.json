	"intro": "ATOMIK: RunGunJumpGun is a tough as nails 2D Action Platformer that puts a teeth-rattling, gravity-defying weapon in your hands. With a cast of crazed characters, simple but beautifully difficult gameplay, and a pulsing musical score, ATOMIK: RunGunJumpGun is a loud, trippy mess of twitchy platforming goodness.\n\nThe two-button setup is disarmingly simple. One button shoots downwards, propelling you through the air. The other shoots forward, destroying anything that\u2019s in your path. There is no stopping in this beautifully surreal world littered with deadly traps and soul-crushing obstacles around every corner. Players will have to constantly alternate between the two firing modes to maneuver through meticulously crafted levels where death is a promise not a possibility. There is only running, gunning, jumping, and gunning, in a mad dash to survive long enough to die again.  \n\nGame features:\n\u2022        Beautifully Difficult: Every second counts, and the game will test your reflexes to the fullest \n\u2022        Nonstop Action: Merciful respawns let you die fast and keep you constantly in the action\n \u2022        Two button gameplay: One button lets you fly, the other blasts obstacles into heaps of rubble.\n \u2022        Three Unique Game Worlds: Each world presents its own distinct challenges which require players to change their playstyles \n\u2022        Over 120 levels of Mayhem: Each level is meticulously crafted to hone and test the player\u2019s speed and tenacity. \n\u2022        Marathon Mode: For players looking to compete for the global high score. \n\u2022        Surreal visuals: Trippy and hyper-colourful fantasy-sci-fi art style \n\u2022        Hyperkinetic soundtrack: Pulsing musical score blending hip hop, electronic and movie-score vibes. \n\u2022        Warped space-opera narrative:  The game features a cast of crazed, beautifully illustrated characters. \n\u2022        Masochistic Collectables: The quest to collect \u201cAtomiks\u201d littered throughout levels lends an extra level of insanity to already merciless level design. A gift to self-hating completionists.\n \u2022        Accessible single-hand gameplay: Appropriate for players with disabilities. \n\u2022        Made by free range developers fed a pure mixture of VVVVVV, Hotline Miami, and Super Meat Boy.  \n",
