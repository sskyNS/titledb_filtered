	"description": "Get ready for ground-smashing fun and leafy adventures! In Beetle Shock, you control a strong beetle capable of breaking cracked logs with a powerful ground pound. Each level is a small forest mission: find the yellow fruit, open the door, and reach the insect house hidden inside a tree trunk.\n\nAcross 30 levels split between day and night biomes, you jump across platforms, use bouncy mushrooms and cannon plants to launch yourself through the scenery, and explore every corner in search of collectible fireflies, perfect for completionists. It\u2019s a light, colorful platformer made for players who enjoy accessible action with a touch of exploration.\n\nThe path isn\u2019t always safe: clover-shaped saws, dangerous spikes, and tricky platforms will test your reflexes. Luckily, sunflowers act as checkpoints, saving your progress and getting you back into the action quickly without losing collectibles. Difficulty increases smoothly, introducing new challenges without breaking the fun flow.\n\nBeetle Shock is ideal for fans of classic platformers, nature lovers, and players who enjoy collecting everything along the way. A charming adventure full of personality, where every jump, every ground pound, and every firefly collected adds to the fun.",
