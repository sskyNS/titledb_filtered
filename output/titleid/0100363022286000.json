	"description": "A command-based adventure game inspired by Norse mythology, released by Micro Cabin in 1984 in Japan. The game gained attention at the time for its beautiful digitized images, pseudo-animation effects achieved by sliding graphics, and its uniquely thought-provoking narration.\n\nLinda, a young girl offered as a sacrifice to appease the dragon\u2019s wrath. Hearing the desperate plea of her sister, you set out on a journey to the sacrificial altar in the distant north.\n\nBattle monsters in the Forest of Confusion, encounter fairies, and push through the maze-like woods. Find the sacred sword hidden in the Three-pronged Cave.\n\nThen, defeat the dragon and rescue Linda, the girl chosen as the sacrifice.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
