They are used in sports, at war... and for you, they are moneymakers.\nBecome Mech Mechanic and open your own workshop to dismantle, fix and rebuild gigantic robots. \nEvery mech has its own special purpose and as a Mech Mechanic not only will you be able to diagnose, repair or change the parts but also paint, update and accommodate mechs for their new function. \nEven if you\u2019re the best Mech Mechanic in the world, you\u2019ll find the parts that are unfixable. Do what you can with what you\u2019ve got, but if you find some junk among your parts\u2026 dismount it and order new ones. If you don\u2019t like wasting things, don\u2019t worry!

Can you maintain a good reputation?\nBecome an expert in your field and compete with the most powerful corporations of the future.
