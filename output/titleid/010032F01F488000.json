	"intro": "A minimalist game about building and defending your little kingdom.\n",
	"description": "Saddle the horses! See your kingdom come to life, fight gripping battles to defend it and still be done in time for lunch.\n\nWith Thronefall we tried to strip a classic strategy game from all unnecessary complexity, combining it with some healthy hack and slay. Build up your base during the day, defend it til your last breath at night.\n\nWill you be able to strike the right balance between economy and defence? Do you need more archers, thicker walls or an additional mill? Will you keep the enemies at bay with your longbow or charge your horse right into them? It's going to be a tough night, but nothing beats seeing the sun rise above your little kingdom to live another day.",
