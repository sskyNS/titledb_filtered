An invitation to the next fight will be sent once the required fees have been transferred via ATM.\n\nUse your skills to dominate opponents!\n\nEnjoy even more hardcore slash-\u2018em-up action than ever before as you use the Joy-Con\u2019s intuitive controls to wield Travis Touchdown\u2019s trusty Beam Katana along with a slew of pro wrestling techniques!\n\nAlso, featured for the first time in the series, Travis can now use his Death Glove to activate a variety of skills, allowing for more strategic battles. Furthermore, you can now customize the new Skill Tree and try out different Death Glove Chip combinations to find the play style that works best for you.\n\nIt\u2019s the Galaxy vs. the Hood in a full-on war by proxy.\n\nBonus in-game T-shirt included!",
