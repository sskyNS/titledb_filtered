	"description": "ROGUEMATCH: THE EXTRAPLANAR INVASION\n\nWhen a Nekomancer's curiosity drags her friends- the Binkying Bungeoneer and the Shield-Bashing Paladinu - into a hunt for the Nekonomicon, they stumble upon an army of extraplanar monsters\u2014and now, only the most unlikely heroes can save reality! To survive, they'll need to master improvised mana tactics, because their usual swords and spells won't cut it!\n\nMELEE, MAGIC, MATCH, OR MANEUVER:\nDirectly attack your foe, cast a spell, injure enemies by matching mana next to them, or dodge deadly attacks? Every turn requires careful thinking.\n\nFACE A CASTLE OVERRUN BY VARIOUS ELEMENTS AND ELEMENTALS!\nLava burns you in the Cryovolcanic stages, but they burn enemies too!\nYou can get stuck in the mud in the Electric Swamp, but that protects you from electricity!\nHide in the sandclouds in the Humid Desert to ambush an enemy!\nWhen you face Orochill, run from the ice blasts!\nIf you face Cathulhu, brave her air beams!\n\nDISCOVER DIFFERENT PLAYSTYLES\nMix six unique heroes with six mana-based powers to create wild strategies like:\nBoarlock + Time Set = Stop time and take extra turns. Do you think you can finish a run in one turn?\nSowceress + Match Set = Rain down long-range destruction.\nBirbarian + Bomb Set = Become a close-range melee expert.\nThen, refine your build further with random spells, items, and upgrades found in the mysterious castle!\n\nROGUELIKE SYSTEMS\nProcedurally Generated Floor maps: No two runs are the same\u2014face different level layouts and randomised treasure drops each time.\nTough but Fair: When a run ends, the castle takes back all your items and spells you have found. You start again, with nothing.\nSpells and Enemies: Use 170+ spells/items to fight against 70+ enemies and bosses, each with their own elemental weakness and strengths.\n\nWill you outsmart the extraplanar invasion... or will your realm collapse because of one book?",
