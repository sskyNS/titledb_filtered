	"description": "Peaked Climbing drops you on a mysterious island with just one way out: climbing the massive mountain at its center. No guide, no shortcuts\u2014just you, your wits, and a sheer cliff daring you to reach the top.\n\nScale four dangerous biomes, each packed with obstacles that\u2019ll test your patience and skill. Miss a step, and you\u2019ll pay for it with precious stamina or a painful fall. Hunt for anything that can help you survive\u2014from suspicious snacks to strange gadgets\u2014and patch yourself up when the mountain shows no mercy.\n\nKeep climbing, plan carefully, and make the most of every quirky item you find. Each slip will cost you, but every determined step brings you closer to the peak.\n\nDo you have what it takes to conquer the climb\u2014or will the mountain send you tumbling like yesterday\u2019s laundry? Grab your gear, and don\u2019t look down!",
