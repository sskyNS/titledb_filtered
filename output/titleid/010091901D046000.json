	"description": " Chicken Police: Into the HIVE! is a character-driven, story-rich, film-noir detective adventure in which you must uncover a complex, world-scale conspiracy by gathering clues, interrogating suspects, and solving puzzles.\n\nSonny and Marty, the Wilderness's toughest detectives, are about to embark on the biggest case of their lives, which will take them through the insect underworld and force them to face the darkest reaches of their past. \n\nThe soul of the game is the characters that bring it to life. There are over 30 deeply fleshed-out characters to talk to, all of them handcrafted, animated, and 100% voice-acted. The Wilderness is a world with a history that goes back thousands of years and is full of fascinating facts and mysteries. Explore the city of Clawville and, with it, its anthropomorphic inhabitants' colorful cultures, traditions, desires, and fears. \n\nYou're in for a story that will affect the fate of a whole city, even the whole world, and yet it's also very intimate, and \"human.\" Murder, betrayal, conspiracy, loss, friendship, and love await you in this dramatic and absurd adventure.\n\nThe Wilderness is collapsing! Riots, dubious schemes, political corruption, and mass psychosis! Sonny and Marty, the two famous rooster detectives, must investigate a case that leads them to the Hive, a walled ghetto of insects. \n\nAmidst a mound of misery and oppression, they stumble upon a worldwide conspiracy as they struggle with their own demons. The question is: will they remain \"human\" in the end? Or will they have to go WILD to set the world straight again?\n",
