	"description": "Get ready for an underground adventure full of charm and strategy! In Mole Cart Mining, you guide a determined little mole riding a mine cart while rotating tracks on a hexagonal grid to create the perfect route. The goal is simple and satisfying: collect every mineral and reach the exit in style.\n\nEach level is a tiny puzzle filled with classic pieces like straights, curves, and junctions, plus the game\u2019s chaotic star, the rotating conveyor, which spins automatically when the cart crosses it. It changes everything mid-route and demands smart planning that mixes order, timing, and a bit of underground boldness.\n\nWith 30 handcrafted levels split between the Iron Mines and Diamond Mines, the game offers short, clean, relaxing challenges with clear objectives. Every solution brings that genuine \u201caha!\u201d moment when everything clicks into place.\n\nMole Cart Mining is perfect for fans of clever puzzles, smart routes, and that satisfying feeling of watching the mole slide along exactly the path you planned. No frustration here, just good ideas, good tracks, and plenty of mining fun.",
