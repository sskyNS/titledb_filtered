	"description": "Sleep has the power to transport us to wonderfully enigmatic places, sometimes frightening and often unexpected. Lucid Cycle is an exploration of the concepts and experiences common to our dreams, whether it\u2019s solving environmental puzzles without a clear purpose or journeying through a shifting landscape without knowing the final destination. Sometimes we might find ourselves in familiar places with unfamiliar circumstances or vice versa, but is there a greater meaning behind it all?\n\nPresented in a first-person perspective, Lucid Cycle casts you as the dreamer, exploring a series of short yet vivid scenarios. Make sense of each to transport yourself to the next scene. You may need to locate a hidden object, leap across platforms suspended in space or retrace your steps to find your way forward. None of these vignettes are the same, but they\u2019re all paint on the same tapestry.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Journey through a series of beautifully crafted ethereal scenarios.\n\u2022 Explore fully 3D environments from a first-person perspective.\n\u2022 Solve puzzles and overcome light platforming sequences.\n\u2022 Locate objects hidden in trippy locations!\n\u2022 Enjoy a soothing casual experience without fear of death or failure.",
