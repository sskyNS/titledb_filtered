	"description": "You awaken in a desolate, forsaken place. A thick, eerie mist surrounds you, shrouding the crumbling buildings ahead. The air is heavy with abandonment\u2026 yet an unseen presence watches you from the shadows.\nWith every passing moment, the unease deepens. The mist is not just a natural phenomenon\u2014it moves, it shifts, it follows. At times, it hides you. Other times, it hides something far worse.\nYour memory is fragmented, offering no answers as to how you arrived here. The only clues lie in scattered notes and the unsettling sounds that beckon you further into the unknown.\n\nAbout Game:\n\t\u2022\tExplore a decayed, forgotten world filled with mysteries and lurking horrors.\n\t\u2022\tStruggle to survive in a hostile environment where resources are scarce.\n\t\u2022\tRely on stealth\u2014sometimes, escape is your only option.\n\nUnravel the secrets of the mist and the truth behind your lost memories.\n\t\u2022\tExperience psychological horror with reality distortions, auditory hallucinations, and shifting environments.\n\t\u2022\tDynamic Mist: More than an atmosphere\u2014it observes, manipulates, and controls what you perceive.\n\t\u2022\tUnseen Threats: Not all dangers are visible\u2014sometimes, you only feel their presence.\n\nSilent Mist is not just a horror game. It is a descent into fear, isolation, and the secrets that should have remained lost in the fog.",
