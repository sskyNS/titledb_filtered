	"description": "After a record-breaking nap spanning several millennia, Kent finds himself in the year 10,000 with nothing but a stick and a dry sense of humor. Tired, hungry, and still employed, he will need to explore the unknown to craft the machines that will turn his broken space module into a self-sufficient base of operations. Prepare to craft to survive and automate to thrive.\n\nEXPLORE, SCAN, CATALOGUE\nDiscover the wonders and the oddities of a vast, ever-changing world filled to the brim with fascinating flora, fauna, and climate events. Classify every animal, plant, and mineral in order to help you survive the passing seasons. Knowledge is your greatest weapon. But don\u2019t try to use knowledge against certain animals, you WILL get eaten.\n\nCRAFT IT TO THE LIMIT\nUse every material at your disposal to build your base. Start small by turning bone and wood into coal, machine scraps into sheets of metal, and slowly but surely grow your base into a full-blown resource-generating machine that can rival any factory in the world.\n\nSURVIVE... OR NOT! YOU'LL BE CLONED ANYWAYS\nEven though Kent will be revived endlessly, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that dying is a major drag. To not bite the dust constantly, you\u2019ll need to gather and hunt for food, find new recipes, and polish your cooking skills. Building your own farms and vivariums is your ticket to a steady source of nourishment.\n\nBUILD THE HOMEBASE OF YOUR DREAMS\nExpand your home base and create an automated system to allow you to streamline and optimize your productions while you are off exploring.\n\nTRAVERSE EXOTIC LOCALES IN STYLE\nFrom vibrant jungles to desolate ruins, traverse post-apocalyptic Earth with your hoverboard, hang glider, grappling hook and more. It is up to you to maneuver with equal parts adventure and efficiency.",
