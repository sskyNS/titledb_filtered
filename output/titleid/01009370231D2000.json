	"description": "ENTER THE DUNGEON\nThe city of Wizarest has been cut off from communication with the outside world. Those who have awakened have forgotten who they are, who their neighbors are, and live without any memories of their past. The only things they know are the dangers of the dungeons surrounding the city, the monsters that inhabit them, and the magic needed to counter them. The citizens have been trying to navigate the dungeons for years, but to no avail. Even after 100 years, no exit has been found. Now, a new wizard is heading into the dungeons to defy the monsters\u2026\n\nTHE BATTLE SYSTEM\nWelcome to WiZmans World Re;Try! This is a thrilling RPG adventure with a fantastic story that changes based on your choices, and a deep yet simple battle system. Make full use of the timeline above the screen to develop your strategy: read the enemy's HP, the attack order, everyone's status, and aim for the most effective way to win. Water is stronger than Fire, Fire is stronger than Wind, Wind is stronger than Earth, and Earth is stronger than Water. Keep this in mind and use the best attacks to counter the enemy. Don't forget to chain attacks to defeat enemies quickly!\n\nMEET THE HOMUNCULI\nAt first glance, the homunculi of WiZmans World Re;Try look like fairies. They have the power to ease the souls of defeated monsters and can fuse with them through Anima Fusion. Thanks to Anima Fusion, they can inherit the stats, status effects, skills, and appearance of defeated monsters. Adopt stronger monster abilities, inherit skills, and create your own powerful guardian. With the homunculi at your side, you're never truly alone!\n\nA CLASSIC FROM 2009\nJaleco, known for releasing games until 2000, launched this RPG classic on portable consoles in 2009. The game features well-drawn pixel graphics and a simple yet challenging difficulty level, earning high praise from RPG fans. In this remaster, the graphics have been enhanced, the BGM rearranged, new tracks added (all remade by soLi), and the UI and playability optimized. This is the ultimate version of WiZmans World, with all the charm of the original.",
