	"intro": "Don't follow the squeak \u2014 it follows you.",
	"description": "You find yourself trapped in the endless maze of the Backrooms \u2014 but you\u2019re not alone. Somewhere in the humming corridors, something strange waddles in the dark. A duck\u2026\n\nWhat begins as a simple search for an exit quickly turns into a survival chase. Sometimes you hear soft footsteps\u2026 sometimes a quiet squeak right behind you.\nThe deeper you go, the weirder it gets: distorted rooms, looping hallways, impossible spaces, and the unsettling presence of the duck that always seems one step closer.\n\nStay alert, navigate the shifting rooms, and outsmart the creature hunting you.\nRun when you must. Hide when you can.\nAnd whatever you do, don\u2019t look back when you hear the squeak.",
