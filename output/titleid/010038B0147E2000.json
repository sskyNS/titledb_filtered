Not only that, but his boss from his second job keeps sending him text messages, distracting him from his task at hand!\n\nIn this short but sweet, horrifying introduction to the Silver Falls universe, players can enjoy classic survival horror puzzle solving.  Story Mode offers a tightly knit, easy to digest standalone episode in the world of Silver Falls. Explore densely detailed environments.
