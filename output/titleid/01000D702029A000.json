	"description": "Enter Jerry Anker or at least he\u2019d like to enter. Considered the dillweed of town, Jerry didn\u2019t get invited. Now he\u2019s far from a badass, but his theoretical knowledge about gender relations is as broad as his cunning. He\u2019ll need that, his wits, a sense of humor and the outside-the-box thinking to outsmart the lugheads and scrubs keeping him from his goal. A hot date with at least one of the lovely gals at the party!\n\nJerry Anker and the Quest to get Love! is a nostalgic successor to some of the best when it comes to naughty Point and Click Adventures! Beyond an amazing handcrafted 2D world, you\u2019ll find familiar characters, fun banter and plenty of lusty times in this fresh and saucy tale.\n\nBut never forget. Only with your help does Jerry stand a chance to achieve his goal. Don\u2019t leave him hanging!",
