	"description": "They are on a secret mission and must face varied audiences and bosses to complete their quest.\n\nCruel Bands Career features highly varied gameplay and a unique art style.\n\nThe three-man band is on a secret mission, the only thorn in their side being the constant stream of audience. Keep an eye on the mood of your band members and gain control of the situation by adjusting their on-stage positions and using their abilities.\n\nAs you progress, you must choose which abilities to upgrade, or when to sneak into a secret room for a nap or two. But your final goal remains the same, to explore an increasingly dangerous world.\n\nSeveral Selectable Characters: Each musician has their own unique abilities which can be used to deal with the detestable audience or the huge bosses.\n\nPerformance Spectators: You unlock friends during your journey, and these friends play their part as they twist and turn in ways which they believe to be dance moves.\n\nHighlights\n\nObserve how the audience act and move, and devise strategies for how to best handle the blighters.\n\nThe Glass Heart Band face challenges brought on by a cruel world!",
