	"description": "In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a small group of survivors seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call 'Onbu'.\nBecome their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with Onbu to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world.\n\nBuild your village\nA functioning village is the basis of your survival. Build your settlement and expand it over Onbu\u2019s back. Plan production chains and optimise them to utilise the limited space as efficiently as possible. Create a society that can overcome any challenge.\n\nLive on the creature\u2019s back\nLiving on the back of another organism comes with its own set of challenges. Will you live in symbiosis, bond with Onbu and survive on mutual trust? Or will you become a parasite, only aiming to ensure a better life for your villagers? The choice is yours.\n\nDiscover different biomes\nContinuously adapt your village as you travel through a multitude of different biomes, each with its unique climate zones, opportunities and threats. Scout your environments and send out foraging missions to gather rare resources and ancient artefacts. \n\nResearch new technologies\nRemnants of the old world hold knowledge that has long been forgotten, but can be unearthed by your villagers. Find and research these technologies, but use them wisely, as progress can be a double-edged sword.\n\nSurvive the wastelands\nEnsure the survival of both your villagers and your Onbu, even though poisonous spores, merciless weather, bloodsucking parasites and many more challenges mean that the odds are often stacked against you.",
