	"description": "Color Breakers is back, this time with even more colors to break! Invite your friends and enjoy cooperative (or competitive) multiplayer modes on dozens of levels designed for up to eight players - with procedurally generated paintings and gameplay twists in each level. And that\u2019s not all: Fancy a story? Color Breakers 2 introduces a completely new story mode, using the procedural generation to keep it fresh with each playthrough.\n\nIntroducing: Story Mode \nIt\u2019s time to save the Color Museum! Robbers have stolen masterpieces from its halls and it\u2019s your job to go out into the world to save them. Travel from the cold, mountainous Breakerville, to the arid deserts of Wild Wild Breaker, to the ancient secrets of the Temple of the Lost Color, all in order to recreate the masterworks of old, one color at a time. Each location has a unique canvas, with a procedurally generated painting to rebuild and different goals and challenges to keep every playthrough fresh!\n\nOnline and Local Co-Op \nThe floor\u2019s your canvas - but it\u2019s always better with friends! Race the clock with up to eight players online - or discover your next party game thanks to local multiplayer. Collaborate on the next great work of art with friends, working together on unique masterpieces in new, crazy locations - just be careful not to step on each other\u2019s toes. Completing each painting is trickier than it seems\u2026\n\nVersus Mode!  \nOf course, you can always go from accidentally stepping on each other\u2019s toes to deliberately doing just that. The new and improved Versus Mode pits players in a race to become the next great painter, trying to complete the painting ahead of the opposing team. It\u2019s the ultimate painting competition: Can you complete the paintings before the other team, navigating the unique challenges of each canvas, the pitfalls of team communication, and of course the pressure of the competition\u2019s brushes\u2026",
