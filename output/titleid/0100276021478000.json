	"description": "Embark on an uplifting journey through the mind of Tom in Unwording. Solve word puzzles, explore the neighborhood through multiple perspectives, and help Tom work towards experiencing a better day by overcoming his negative self-talk and thought patterns.\n\nTom sees the world through a lonely, glass-half-empty lens. To him, everyday objects morph into complex word puzzles, reminding him of all that he lacks. As he solves each puzzle, the solutions spell out messages that are irrational and defeating.\n\n\nUntil one day, he forgets to shut his window and lets a mischievous little yellow bird into his life, turning his life upside down.\n\nThe bird's mischief causes chaos, and by solving word puzzles and exploring his neighborhood, Tom must begin to see things from a different perspective, changing his mindset and transforming his life and the world around him.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- Three distinct art styles that reflect Tom's inner world - from 2D to 2.5D to 3D.\n- A heartfelt story told without uttering a single word of dialogue.\n- Challenging word puzzles that change as each in-game day passes, telling their own story.\n- Optional \u201cEasy mode\u201d if you\u2019re here just for the story, not the challenge.\n- A soothing and tender soundtrack by Trevor Kowalski that evolves with the game.",
