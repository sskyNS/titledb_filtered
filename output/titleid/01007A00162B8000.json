	"intro": "Discover the world from the eyes of a fox. Explore the unknown and rescue your captured friend.",
	"description": "Lost Dream tells a story about your friend being taken away by humans. You wake up one day determined to rescue her. Explore the lengths a fox would go to rescue his friend. Travel through the world, experience the path to change your life.\n\nGraphic design is one of the most important things in this game along with the Soundtrack, One of the main goals is to make the player relaxed and to give them an experience they won't forget.\n\nThe length of the game is fairly short, discovering everything should only take you about an hour at best, but speeding through will be much faster.\n\nImportant side information is that the game does not include a saving system, since it's very easily playable in one sitting, so please keep that in mind before starting the game.",
