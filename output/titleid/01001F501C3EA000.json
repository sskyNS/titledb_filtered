However, the Schwarzschild Empire's declaration of war plunges the world into chaos once more. From the frontier city of Heiland, a new story of resilience and hope unfolds.\n\nAlphadia II: Two centuries have passed since the Energi Crisis thwarted the empire's ambitions and saved the world from destruction.
