	"description": "- Story\nOur tale starts with two protagonists: Gustave, heir to an esteemed royal line, and Wil, a young man who makes his way in the world performing excavation work.\n\nThough born in the same era, their circumstances could not be more different, and as Gustave is faced with strife and conflict between nations, Wil finds himself confronting a world-threatening calamity that lurks in the shadows.\nTheir stories gradually coalesce to form a single history.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThe game's \"History Choice\" system gives players the freedom to choose which events to play, and in doing so has them assume the roles of various characters and experience the world's history in fragments.\nIn addition to the Glimmer and Combo mechanics that the SaGa series is known for, this title also features one-on-one duels.\nPlayers will find themselves confronted with battles both strategic and highly compelling.\n\n------------------------------\n\nNew Features\nFor this remaster, the game's impressionist watercolor graphics have been upgraded to a higher resolution, giving them a greater sense of warmth and delicacy.\nWith a completely rebuilt UI and a number of new features, the gameplay experience is smoother than ever.\n\n- New Events\nEvents that touch on stories previously untold in the original have been added, as well as a number of characters who are newly playable in battle.\nThrough these additions, players will be able to experience the world of Sandail like never before.\n\n- Character Growth\nA new feature called \"Parameter Inheritance\" lets one character inherit the stats of another, allowing for greater customization.\n\n- Featuring Enhanced Bosses!\nA number of powerful, augmented bosses have been added for those seeking a greater challenge.\n\n- Dig! Dig! Digger\nDiggers you recruit in-game can be sent on expeditions.\nShould an expedition end in success, diggers will come home with items\u2014but watch out, because they have a bad habit of slacking off when left unsupervised!\n\n- Gameplay Improvements\nWith the addition of things like high-speed functionality and a New Game+ mode that allows you to carry over your completion data, changes have been made to create a more comfortable gameplay experience.\n\nLanguages: English, Japanese",
