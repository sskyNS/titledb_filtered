	"description": "Castle Kong is Drowning Monkeys homage to what we consider the best game ever made.\n\nWhat makes the golden age of arcade gaming so fun is a simple concept: 1 coin (Meaning no restarts or additional lives. there are no actual or virtual coins for the Switch version of the game), 3 lives. play till you die or hit the kill screen, and set a high score.\n\nAnd that's what Castle Kong is all about. Just like the game it's based on, CK will be a ruthless, 4 stage, 22 level romp! You play PauperBoy, a young kid who sets out to save PrincessGirl from the evil clutches of BaronMan.\n\nUnlike it's predecessors, we leverage the power of connectivity to host tournaments (with a championship!), verify high scores, and have a global leaderboard.\n\nAnd As Always,\nif anyone's interested, a kill screen is coming up.",
