	"description": "Live a summer of dysfunctional love through branching storylines, twists, sudden changes, and a special mechanic where you choose which senses to use with your boyfriend. In these moments, you will learn about him, his personality, and his past, making you question everything.\n\nMilky Way Prince is a semi-autobiographical story entirely designed, programmed, illustrated, and scored by a young author, Lorenzo Redaelli.\n\"During my experience with a borderline partner, I thought that falling in love with him was like becoming part of a binary star system. It\u2019s the rarest, most precious thing in the universe \u2013 but the closer they get the more unstable they become.\"\n\"My idea was to create an immersive experience where the player is asked to try to understand the dynamics of this unusual relationship. The character you interact with adapts their behavior to yours \u2013 using academic terminology, they could set up \u201crage tests\u201d, \u201clove bombing\", or otherwise guilt trip you. The plot's branching storyline is guided by variables such as \u201csubmission\u201d and \"interest\u201d that fluctuate at each interaction.\"\n",
