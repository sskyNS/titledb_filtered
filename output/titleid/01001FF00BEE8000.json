	"description": "The Shapeshifting Detective is a supernatural-noir murder mystery FMV game. Play as a detective and investigate the murder by shapeshifting into any character. Even the next victim.  \n\nDorota Shaw is dead. And the prime suspects are three tarot readers with the uncanny ability to predict murder - or commit it. It\u2019s your job to find out what else they know - but they won\u2019t reveal their dark secrets to just anyone\u2026 Luckily, you can be anyone you want to be.\n\nThe game features more than 1600 full HD video responses, a simple questioning interface with unique \u2018delete\u2019 mechanic, and a randomly chosen murderer at the start of the game. Developed by the World Record-breaking makers of \"The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker\".\n\n\u25cf Shapeshift - into nine other characters so you can investigate and manipulate relationships from all angles, and unlock the other half of the story.\n\u25cf Suspense - solve a murder, stop a murder, don\u2019t get caught. Any one of three random murderers helps to minimize spoilers.\n\u25cf Choices matter - catch the killer, save the victims, make and break relationships \u2013 or don\u2019t.\n\u25cf Problem solving - can\u2019t get that vital clue yourself? Try shapeshifting into the Police Chief. Think the dialogue options are a trap? Delete them. \n\u25cf 100% FMV - an entire game of smooth FMV cutscenes and responses in first person perspective.\n\u25cf Catalytic events - not all branching is binary. Push someone into a corner and they may have more than one way to react.",
