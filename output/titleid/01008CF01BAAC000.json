Left alone, it\u2019s up to Princess Zelda to save her kingdom in a brand-new adventure in the Legend of Zelda\u2122 series! \n\nTeam up with an ethereal creature named Tri to use the Tri Rod\u2014a mysterious staff that allows Zelda to create \u201cechoes,\u201d which are imitations of things you find in the environment like objects or monsters. Once you learn an echo, you can use Tri\u2019s power to recreate it whenever you like\u2014no crafting necessary!\u2014to solve puzzles and defeat enemies your own way. To reach a treasure chest, you might stack beds to create a staircase, pick up a crow to glide across a gap, or stack water blocks to swim up to it. The approach is up to you!\n\nTraverse the land\u2019s obstacles and conquer its rifts \n\nYour quest to save Hyrule will span far and wide across its many regions\u2014from the sandstorms of Gerudo Desert to the sparkling lakes and rivers of Jabul Waters. In your travels, you\u2019ll encounter rifts that are spreading across the land. To close the rifts and save the people trapped inside, Zelda and Tri must enter each one and use their powers to traverse broken terrain and defeat dungeon bosses. \n\nZelda can use other abilities in combination with echoes, including transforming into a powerful swordfighter for a short time. With these abilities, you\u2019ll be fully equipped to tackle every challenge in creative ways.\n\nYou can also make travel across Hyrule faster by using waypoints and your horse!\n\nDiscover side quests and minigames\n\nAs you explore Hyrule, you\u2019ll meet all kinds of interesting people with their own storylines\u2014some dealing with problems great or small, and others who might just have fun challenges for you! You\u2019ll also encounter the engineer Damp\u00e9 who is looking for someone to help him create powerful wind-up gizmos.\n\nEquip accessories and visit Smoothie Shops for bonus effects\n\nTry on different outfits and accessories to gain various effects such as the ability to jump higher. Visit a Smoothie Shop to blend up your ingredients into tasty drinks capable of replenishing your hearts and granting temporary bonuses like resistance to electricity. \n\nScan any Legend of Zelda\u2122 themed amiibo\u2122 figures* to get rewards, like smoothie ingredients and certain outfits in alternate colors.\n",
