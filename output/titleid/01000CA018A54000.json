She knows everything about the epic adventures of pirate legend Captain Cabeca, but in her everyday life, she is just surrounded by boring fishermen and unsuccessful pirates, hanging around at the counter.\nBut when Cleo finds a strange pirate-logbook and sees a ghost, who gives her a mysterious hint, her boring life is about to get turned upside down. She is thrown into a dangerous adventure and finds herself in a world of lies, deceit, greed and bad breath - the world of pirates - and most of them are looking for the same thing:\nTHE TREASURE OF ETERNAL MEMORY.\n\nKRAKEN FODDER:\n\"Kraken Fodder\" is a mini game inside the game.\nIt is a card and dice game, which is taken pretty seriously among fishermen and pirates. One round takes about 5 minutes and the game is about destroying your opponents card deck with canon balls. HAHAHAR!\nThroughout the game, Cleo has to play this card game against a few NPCs.\n\nThe game was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2020.\nARRRGH!",
