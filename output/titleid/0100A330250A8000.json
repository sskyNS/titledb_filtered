	"description": "In Tidy Toys, even the mess has its charm. In this casual puzzle with a touch of kitchen creativity, your mission is to organize the ingredients\u2014or rather, toys\u2014into pots styled like gift boxes. The goal is to fit all the pieces onto the board and fulfill the demanding orders of the customers.\n\nStart with simple grids and basic toys, but don\u2019t get too comfortable. As the levels progress, the boards grow larger, the shapes get trickier, and the challenges demand more strategy. Rotate, move, and place each piece carefully so no space is left behind, and earn those coveted stars.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more: every stage comes with special customer requests. You can ignore them and move forward, but can you resist the temptation to complete everything perfectly?\n\nWith 30 delightfully crafted levels, Tidy Toys delivers a relaxing, challenging, and highly addictive experience, perfect for puzzle lovers who want to prove they can put everything neatly in its place.",
