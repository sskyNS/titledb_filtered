	"intro": "The largest zombie mop-up operation this world has ever seen is about to start! Mind you heads, zombies!",
	"description": "-Game Description\nZombie's Cool is a growth-type shooting action game in which you have to mop up zombies that frequently pop up in town while searching for the root of the zombie virus.\n\n-Weapon System\n\u25a0 Single Shot Pistol: You can use it limitlessly, but its firepower is weak.\n\u25a0 Machine Gun: The damage dealt per bullet is low, but since its per-second firing speed is high, you can deal a lot of damage within a short time.\n\u25a0 Shotgun: It has a short range, but it deals a lot of damage to multiple enemies.\n\u25a0 Launcher: Along with an explosion, it inflicts physical damage on multiple enemies and also causes flame damage, which zombies can spread to each other.\n\u25a0 Laser Gun: No matter what kind of enemy you're facing, they can be brought down with a single shot from this gun.\n\u25a0 Double-handed Pistols: Shots that hit enemies irregularly bounce of to other areas. If you're lucky, you can bring down multiple foes with a single shot.\n\u25a0 Gunkata: Fire double-handed pistols at random with a cool pose.\n\n-Stage Types\n\u25a0 Normal Stage: All you have to do is wipe out enemies. It's the ideal type of stage for earning coins.\n\u25a0 Death Race Stage: Within a time limit, you have to exterminate zombies on the map with a zombie car.\n\u25a0 Baseball Stage: You have to stop the zombies rushing to home with baseballs.\n\u25a0 Barricade Stage: You have to stop the zombies trying to get through the barricade.\n\u25a0 Escort Stage: You have to escort survivors to the escape point.\n\u25a0 Big Escape Stage: You have to drive a tank to the escape point while defeating the enemies swarming upon you.\n\u25a0 Boss Stage: Zombie's Cool features five bosses who possess varied patterns.\n\n-Coins and Upgrades\nOnce you upgrade your weapons' and the player's abilities, stages you once thought were difficult will be able to be cleared with ease. \nAll upgrade elements within the game are carried out using coins.\nYou can earn more and more coins the higher your combo chain number, which rises as you kill enemies, goes. \nBe careful though, the chain is broken if you are attacked by an enemy or if a set amount of time passes without you killing an enemy.\nThat doesn't sound very easy, you say? Well then, maybe you should try replaying the previous stage a few times to collect some money then upgrade your weapons.\nIf you do that, then at some point, you'll be able to enjoy the experience of having coins gush forth suddenly.\nCoins can solve anything in this game!\nJust be sure to remember to maintain your combo chain by not letting enemies attack you!\n\n-Multiple Round Elements\nSo you've seen the first round ending?\nThen you should try the Normal and Hard difficulties too, where even stronger zombies and bosses are awaiting you.\nThanks to diverse zombies risking life and death to fling themselves at you from an early phase, you'll be able to experience a different feeling then you did when you played the Easy difficulty.\n\n-Enemy Types\n\u25a0 Walker: Moving at a sluggish pace, it's ready to become a good source of coins for the player.\n\u25a0 Rusher: Once it approaches a certain distance, it goes mad chasing after the player.\n\u25a0 Smasher: It's not only great at taking blows, it's also got great attack power and mobility.\n\u25a0 Eater: It's the slowest moving of all the zombie types, but also the strongest against attacks, so it will soak up all the bullets you throw at it like a sponge, leaving you with no ammo left.\n\u25a0 Helldog: It's the weakest against attacks, but it leaps all over the place, making the player busy just keeping up with it.\n\u25a0 Crawler: It crawls around on the ground while shooting out scary acidic spit, requiring a continuous exercise of judgment and control from the player.\n\n-Wait just a second...\nDid you just say you don't think you can handle playing, because of all the different enemies?\nThis isn't the first time I'm telling you this, but when you feel like that, you should discuss things with some coins.\nCoins can solve any problem you'll run into in this game!",
