	"description": "Shanghai, the undisputed king of puzzle games for over 30 years, makes a triumphant return!\n\nIn this addictive puzzle game, you must match two tiles at a time with the same design to remove them from the arranged stack.\n\nNew Puzzle Stacks For the First Time in Fifteen Years\n\nFrom beginner-level stacks to the most challenging stacks in Shanghai history, this definitive edition can be enjoyed by puzzlers of all skill levels.\n\nIt's been 5 years since the last Shanghai game, and Shanghai Legend comes packed with over 300 levels! That's a Shanghai record!\n\n\u2022Shanghai is easy to learn, but hard to master! Memory and strategy are the big keys to success. If you want some great brain training, look no further!\n\n\u2022Co-op play is available, so go ahead and enjoy these puzzles with friends, family and more!\n\n\u2022An updated design adds a new layer of polish to the classic gameplay that never gets old even after 30+ years!\n\nTwo Popular Game Modes From Previous Titles Make a Comeback!\n\n\u2022Legend Mode: Beijing\nThis is not your ordinary Shanghai! You can now slide tiles around the board to match and erase pairs, but don't fret! You can also clear tiles with the same rules as normal Shanghai.\n\n\u2022Legend Mode: The Great Wall\nSelect tiles of the same design to tear down the wall of tiles.\nTiles sitting above those that are taken will fall once the tiles are removed.\nThink carefully, or you may find yourself in a tough spot!",
