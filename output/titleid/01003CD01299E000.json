	"description": "A race is not won purely on the track, so you need to become more than a rider by understanding motorcycle behaviour like a real engineer. Traction, angle, braking, torque, trajectory, speed\u2026 every factor must be considered before heading to the workshop to change certain components and configuring the optimal set-up. \n\nA DREAM GARAGE\nYour adventure starts by choosing your dream bike. In RiMS Racing, you can ride the world's 8 most powerful European and Japanese motorcycles: Ducati Panigale V4 R, MV Agusta F4 RC, Aprilia RSV4, BMW M 1000 RR, Suzuki GSX-R1000R, Honda CBR1000RR, Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10RR, Yamaha YZF-R1.

Brake disc temperature, tyre pressure and wear, suspension behaviour affecting stability, electronic settings\u2026 Just like for a real rider, your bike's configuration can be adapted to your riding style!\n\nACCURATE AND REALISTIC PHYSICS\nThe level of accuracy and details provided by the mechanics management and MSC is matched by realistic motorcycle physics that will thrill the most demanding of track racers. But thanks to the various ride assist technologies, less experienced players can still learn the techniques that will take them to the top.\n\nTHE MOST ICONIC CIRCUITS\nSilverstone, Laguna Seca, Suzuka, N\u00fcrburgring, Paul Ricard\u2026 Travel the world and enjoy thrilling races on 10 faithfully recreated official circuits.
