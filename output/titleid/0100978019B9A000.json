They eventually awaken and make it known that they were attacked by a group of dangerous 'misfits' and ran to find shelter, passing out as soon as they entered your home.\n\nYou find out that they are incubi \u2013demons. Out of sympathy, you offer your home as refuge for a while in exchange for minor servitude (it is a big house, after all). They happily agree. \n\nWhat will happen as the incubi get comfy?\nWhy exactly did they come the human world?\nAre you sure that you truly want them gone? \n\n\"Seduce Me - The Complete Story\" is a bundle that includes \"Seduce Me The Otome\", \"Seduce Me 2: The Demon War\". They are both dating sims with 13 mini-episodes, and both have Audio Otome CDs as well as a basic compendium for lore comprehension!\n\n\nFeatures\n* Visual novel dating simulation\n* Date 5 seductive incubi\n* Beautiful bishounen anime / manga art\n* Voice acting\n* Original music soundtrack\n* \"Seduce Me - The Complete Story\" is bundle of \"Seduce Me The Otome\", \"Seduce Me 2: The Demon War\", 13 mini-episodes, and both Audio Otome CDs.",
