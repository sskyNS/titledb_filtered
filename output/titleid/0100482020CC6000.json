	"description": "In 1992, following a series of mysterious deaths caused by wild animals, as well as strange sightings of cryptids in the sparsely populated and underdeveloped Amazon region of Acre, a special operations brigade from the Brazilian Military Police was sent to the area to gather intelligence. However, the situation took an unexpected turn for the soldiers, who soon found themselves cornered in the midst of a jungle infested with hungry dinosaurs.\n\nDuring this odyssey, Sublieutenant Tais D. Oliveira must strive to survive in this scenario, uncovering, in the process, dark secrets surrounding that region of Acre. In that same place, during the 60s and 70s, the Brazilian Military Dictatorship carried out a secret program to develop biological weapons.\n\nWill the soldiers escape alive from Acre? What kind of experiments were conducted in that region? What was the government's role?\n\nFeatures:\n- Short Length: The story mode can be completed in 1-3 hours, depending on the player's skill\n- Replayability: The game features an Arcade mode where quick survival matches can be played\n- Point System: You can collect points that you can later redeem for better weapons or cosmetics for your character\n- Atmospheric: Explore the Amazon jungle with a wide variety of visual and sound effects, weather, and a day-night system that will completely immerse you in the game",
