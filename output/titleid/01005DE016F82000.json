	"description": "Guide this squishy hero through enemy hordes in a turn-based roguelike shooter. Your strategy and quick reflexes are crucial!\nEvery turn of every battle tests your skills. Plan ahead, shoot with precision and prepare to block the incoming enemy attacks!\nAs you push forward, the challenge intensifies, making each victory your best achievement!\n\n\u25a0 What can this little dude do?\n\u00b7 Arm this guy with a different arsenal in each attempt!\n\u00b7 Try all the weapons! There are more than 30 unique weapons, from pistols to sunbeams, guillotines, and even bees!\n\u00b7 Open shiny treasures and expand your gear!\n\u00b7 Visit the shop to buy upgrades and items with your hard-earned money!\n\u00b7 Conquer the 4 unique worlds! Each filled with distinct and dangerous foes!\n... and face off against the mysterious final boss... if you can get there.\n\n\u25a0 What follows?\n\u00b7 Use your points to unlock vibrant new palettes with each run!\n\u00b7 Don't like the prices of the shop? Fight the shopkeeper if you're feeling feisty! But deal with the consequences!\n\n\u25a0 Wait, so... How does Gun Rounds work?\nIn Gun Rounds the basics are: you shoot the enemies, the enemies shoot back at you, you block their attacks, and then you shoot them again!\nYou start with two weapons at random. No two runs are the same.\nWeapons need bullets. You can reload in your turn with a drawback: reloading makes your blocking radius smaller. You also get one bullet for each enemy attack you block.\nBlocking attacks is crucial. You can stop their attacks when the projectiles are inside your blocking radius. Act carefully!\nYou obtain new weapons from chests that appear in the levels. Having a maximum of 4 at the same time.\nWith each enemy you defeat you earn coins.\nAt the end of each world, you can visit the shop to purchase upgrades and special items with the coins you got in this run. There are some freebies too.\nWhen you die (you will die), the remaining coins will be used to unlock new palettes!\n\nGood luck!",
