	"description": "Your adventure leads to defeating a mighty red dragon in the realm of darkness. To slay it, you must wield the legendary sword, \"Dragon Slayer.\" The only clue to the sword's hidden location is the Crown of the King of the Spirits. Your journey must begin by finding this crown. Now, let the journey commence!\n\nThis is a side-view action RPG released in Japan by Nihon Falcom in 1987. Originally launched in 1985, it is the latest installment in its series. Players take on the role of an adventurer exploring 10 stages with the ultimate goal of defeating the King Dragon. The map features shops and roaming monsters, but monsters are finite, disappearing once they\u2019ve been hunted down.\n\nThe game employs a symbol encounter system for battles. Contacting a monster switches to a combat scene where you can attack using weapons (by ramming) or cast spells. Defeating enemies yields treasure chests containing items or money.\n\nIn this game, the player character doesn't have a specific class. Instead, there are two types of experience points and levels\u2014warrior and mage. Your character grows in either discipline depending on how you defeat enemies. Additionally, weapons, armor, and magic have their own experience points, allowing them to become more effective with repeated use. As monsters are finite, so is the experience you can gain. Thus, you\u2019ll need to strategize carefully: will you use weapons or magic to defeat your foes? Managing your character\u2019s and items\u2019 growth effectively will be key to success.\n\nCan you defeat colossal bosses like the giant squid Kraken, the multi-armed giant Kartikea, and the shimmering Silver Dragon, before finally vanquishing the King Dragon? This game, a Japanese PC classic, sold 400,000 copies\u2014a record that remains unbroken. Few titles fit the term \"epoch-making\" as perfectly as this one!\n\nThe MSX version, now being re-released, includes minor changes, such as the addition of item icons for equipped gear, reflecting its later release. Some players prefer the MSX version, making it a notable addition for fans of Xanadu!\n\n\n",
