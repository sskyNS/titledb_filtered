	"description": "You\u2019ve washed ashore on a mysterious island where ancient emojis have awakened \u2014 and they\u2019re not happy to see you.\nThis rogue-like first-person shooter throws you into wild, fast-paced combat against tiki emojis wearing carved masks and wielding primal powers.\nBefore each run, customize your experience with crazy modifiers: make enemies bounce, wear funny hats, or unleash volcanic chaos for maximum challenge. Choose your arena \u2014 from overgrown jungles and hidden beach ruins to ancient temples filled with deadly traps \u2014 each location has its own hazards, secrets, and surprises.\nArmed with just a pistol, you\u2019ll face wave after wave of emojis that rush, leap, explode, or even summon others to fight. Defeat them to collect glowing orbs, level up, and unlock upgrades or powerful new weapons. Each decision shapes your survival \u2014 will you go for raw power, faster reloads, or explosive mayhem?\nEvery battle becomes a frantic dance of dodging lava bursts, leaping over collapsing bridges, and using temple traps to your advantage. The further you go, the wilder the island gets \u2014 until you\u2019re overwhelmed by the ancient emoji horde.\nSurvive long enough, and you\u2019ll uncover new arenas, more upgrades, and deeper chaos for your next run.\nCan you conquer the island before the emojis claim you?",
