	"description": "In the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, the world has gone dark. Cities lie silent, their power grids fractured and failing. You are the only remaining repairman that can restore power to the last safe zones of humanity.\n\nGridz Keeper is an action puzzler featuring 50 levels that challenge you to repair all the generators in them to move on.

Master the grid, anticipate the chain reactions and reclaim the light one generator at a time!\n\n\u2022 Master 50 stages of brainteasing action!\n\u2022 Use your wrench to turn generators on and off!\n\u2022 Strategically activate generators to power them all!\n\u2022 Overcome gradually increasing complexity and difficulty!\n\u2022 Retry stages as many times as it takes!",
