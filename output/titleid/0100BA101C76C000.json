Avoid getting hit by other masks & have fun whackin\u2019 it out with everyone you love!\n\nSurvival Mode (1-4 players):\nDestroy as many Tengu masks as you can, alone or cooperatively with friends!\n\nBattle Mode (2-4 players):\nFight against other players, evading their drums and trying to hit them with yours!",
