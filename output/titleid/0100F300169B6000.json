	"intro": "Destroy... Absorb... Grow... GRIME is a fast and unforgiving Action-Adventure RPG in which you crush your foes with living weapons that mutate form and function.",
	"description": "An unusual material collapses in on itself, the world shudders and contracts, and suddenly you are squeezed into existence.\n\nWhat awaits you is a world unknown, alien in its own familiarity, challenging you to survive the terrors you face. Explore your surreal surroundings, parry and absorb the many enemies you encounter, and use their own traits against them as you become far more than you once were.\n\nGRIME lets you play to your preference, upgrading only those traits you feel most suited to your unique style. You\u2019ll find there is more than one way to break open an enemy as you move through a variety of evocative environments, meet their inhabitants, and discover the source of their madness.",
