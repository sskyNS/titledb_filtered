	"description": "After washing onto the island's shores, you'll find yourself the newly minted owner of a humble plot of land. Pull up your sleeves, grab your tools, and get to work building a farm that will last not only a lifetime but span generations!\n\nEchoes of Plum Grove is a casual, cozy farm simulator where your decisions have consequences. What to plant, what to stock for the winter, and who to befriend will shape not only the town of Honeywood but the island itself.\n\nWinter brings new levels of danger to players. With your very survival at stake, you'll have to work your land, fish the sea, cook meals, craft, forage, and more to ensure you make it through the cold season. Should you neglect to prepare, your lineage could end before anyone can uncover the island's secrets. While your main focus should be on survival, the town of Honeywood puts its best festive foot forward with many celebrations taking place.\n\nHoneywood may be a cozy hamlet, where the people are the heart of the town. Everyone who lives on the island has their own schedules, jobs, traits, hobbies, and children. Work together with your fellow townsfolk to forge an even greater community\u2014or just get them out of the way with harsh words and drastic measures.\n\nBuilding relationships is at the core of Echoes of the Plum Grove. As you grow your family tree and your original character perishes, you'll find yourself playing as someone else within your family. While building relationships is crucial to your experience, take time to explore the island. There are many mysteries to uncover. Some say there's a witch that lives on the island and brings to town strange items. Others swear they've heard something coming from the bay. A few wonder what exists at the bottom of the mines. Adventure to the edges of the island to see what Echoes of Plum Grove has in store for you!",
