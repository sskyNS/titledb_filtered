	"intro": "Can you mix a cocktail while facing a criminal? Find out in Best Served Cold, a murder mystery set in a lively speakeasy where you serve drinks, make allies and foes, and solve crimes.",
	"description": "In an alternate history Europe, \u201cThe Nightcap\u201d is the last speakeasy in town, and you\u2019re pouring the drinks\u2026 while your customers spill their secrets. Mix and serve cocktails with a twist, as you become a detective while trying to save your bar.\n\nListen to your clienteles\u2019 stories and learn about their lives as you unravel a mystery that touches every layer of Bukovie society, from the drunken dandies splashing cash on cocktails, to the crooked cops and seedy lowlifes who try to rope you into their shady schemes.\n\nA good bartender knows the art of conversation is just as important as the ability to pour libations, so listen carefully and keep your wits about you as you delight, charm or even threaten your patrons to get the information you need. With a cast of 22 unique and engaging characters it\u2019s up to you to choose who you can trust, who will have your back\u2026 and who will stab you in it!\n\nOver the course of five cases, you\u2019ll have to explore every clue and question every suspect to save lives\u2026 and save your business.\n\nIt\u2019s time to flip that sign to open, turn up the jazz and welcome your first customers of the night.\n\nBukovie may be a city in strife, with labour strikes, rationing, unrest and the shadow of war looming, but instead of cowering in fear, the citizens flock to dance halls and speakeasies. Crumbling grandeur might inspire melancholy, but that\u2019s nothing a stiff drink won\u2019t cure.\n\nIn a world of dwindling light, your speakeasy is a bonfire in the night. Though the city may soon burn, cocktails are always\u2026\n\nBest Served Cold.",
