The singing of the cicadas and the humid air surrounded me. The air is filled with the faint smell of the sea breeze. \nI'm sitting on a wooden bench in an old station building. \nWhere is this place? And... what am I doing here? \n\nA nostalgic countryside. \nA station marked \"Natsugiri\". \nA single-track railroad. \nAs if stepping out of the purest of white light, I woke up here, my memories gone.\nI could not find anyone in this strange place...",
