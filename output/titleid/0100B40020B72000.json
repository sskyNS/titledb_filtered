	"description": "RALLY YOUR FRIENDS AND HOLD YOUR GROUND!!!\n\nA group of non-adventurers is the last hope in defending the castle in this chaotic co-op tower defense game with roguelike features. With up to 4 players, your party must organize the castle, work as a team to craft ammo, and shoot at enemies to protect your kingdom!\n\nPLAN, CRAFT AND DEFEND THE CASTLE!\n\nUse the power of teamwork to prosper through 15 rounds against hordes of brute invaders by preparing the castle stations, reinforcing your defenses each day and choosing the best curveballs for each scenario.\n\nNO HEROES? NO PROBLEM, SAVE THE DAY ANYWAY!\n\nAs you journey through this medieval realm, recruit more Non-Heroes to your ragtag band of castle defenders, including familiar faces like the Jester and the Princess, and non-heroic newcomers like the Alchemist and the Doctor. Just because you\u2019re not a hero doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t save the day!\n\nTHE KINGDOMS\u2019 FATE IN YOUR HANDS!\n\nProtect three different kingdoms with each their own mechanics, enemies, and quirks. Defend your typical medieval kingdom Noobland, the freezing lands of Trollmeria and the castles overrun by ever-growing mushrooms at Fungaria.\n\nA MEDIEVAL ARSENAL AT YOUR DISPOSAL!\n\nPlay in 30 different castles, separated between easy, normal and hard difficulties. Select the kingdom and choose your weapon from cannons, slingshots and even a baby dragon ready to set hordes of enemies on fire!",
