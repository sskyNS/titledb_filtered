Be careful, if you thrust the spear into stone, you'll be shot backward!\n   \tClimbing Over It with a Spear Only Up aims to discourage you as you attempt to climb a surreal mountain. The higher you climb, the harder the fall. The controls are precise and fair. Falling will depend on your skill. This game is based on \"Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy.\"\n\t\u2022\tClimb to the top.\n\t\u2022\tFalling will be part of the journey.\n\t\u2022\tThey will laugh at you...\n\t\u2022\tPerhaps you'll manage to avoid some falls.\n\t\u2022\tOther times you'll fall right from the start.\n\t\u2022\tWill you feel better upon reaching the top?\n\t\u2022\tOvercome yourself.\n",
