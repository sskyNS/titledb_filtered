	"description": "Tile-matching action gets a new alluring twist in Pretty Girls Rivers! In this fast-paced puzzler, you\u2019ll need to find pairs of tiles similar to mahjong solitaire, but instead of having stacks to clear, Rivers is all about patterns, obstacles and beating the clock. All tiles are revealed and easy to see, allowing you to strategically select pairs and avoid getting trapped. Quick-thinking combos will earn higher scores! And if you don\u2019t feel like racing the clock, switch to easy mode for hints, shuffle assists and a more relaxed play style.\n\nFor every 4 play fields you clear in Pretty Girls Rivers, new outfits will be revealed for your female companions. There are 6 beautiful challengers to meet, all voiced in Japanese and sporting a wardrobe ranging from casual and cute to cool and sexy! Unlocked outfits become available for viewing anytime in an enhanced Dressing Room mode. Will you collect them all?\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Match tiles in puzzle action that\u2019s easy to learn and fun to master!\n\u2022 Clear dozens of stages with unique tile patterns and obstacles.\n\u2022 Unlock outfits to dress up the female challengers!\n\u2022 Meet 6 lovely ladies voiced in Japanese.\n\u2022 Assemble dioramas using newly enhanced Dressing Room features!\n",
