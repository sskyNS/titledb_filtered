	"description": "In MISDIE: Into the Game, one wrong tap on your phone pulls you into a world you were never meant to visit. Bright colors and familiar faces quickly give way to something far stranger\u2014and far more dangerous.\n\nTrapped inside a digital dream that shifts into a nightmare, you\u2019ll follow cryptic clues, encounter characters who aren\u2019t quite what they seem, and piece together the truth hidden beneath the surface. Some will offer help. Others will play games of their own. And somewhere, something is always watching.\n\nBlending vibrant anime visuals with a chilling atmosphere, MISDIE: Into the Game is a journey through mystery, memory, and fear. Trust carefully, move quickly, and remember: in this world, nothing stays friendly for long.",
