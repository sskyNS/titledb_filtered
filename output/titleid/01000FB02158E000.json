	"description": "Inspector Waffles Early Days is a top-down detective adventure with point-and-click mechanics and puzzles to solve, inspired by classic games.\n\nFollow a young Waffles, a cunning and witty cat, in his first days as an Inspector. Your partner, Pancakes, is an experienced Inspector and probably the only one at the police station that isn\u2019t an incompetent policecat. With this top-tier team, catching bad guys could sound easy, but beware\u2026 Your future worst enemy is hiding in the shadows, waiting for you to make the first mistake.\n\nInspector Waffles Early Days is the prequel of Inspector Waffles. But you don't need to play the first game to enjoy this one!\n\nThe game is divided in 5 distinct chapters and 5 cases to solve. It could be theft, arson, drug traffic\u2026 you\u2019ll still have three main actions to do:\n\n- Find clues\n\nInspect crime scenes, follow culprit pawsteps, interact with decors\u2026 There will be a lot of different ways to find clues!\n\n- Interrogate animals of interest\n\nSuspects, witnesses, victims\u2026 you\u2019ll meet a full cast of anthropomorphic animals who will have maybe a lot to say to you, or maybe some secrets to hide. Interrogating them will allow you to know the truth from the lies: ask the right questions, and use the right clue to prove them wrong!\n\n- Report to your partner\n\nAt the end of each case, after that you have interrogated all suspects/witnesses, you need to report to your partner, Pancakes. He\u2019ll ask you a couple of questions: It's up to you to prove that you have the culprit!",
