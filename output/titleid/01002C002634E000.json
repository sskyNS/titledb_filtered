	"description": "Enjoy the relaxing puzzle of Habitat Shapes by organizing spaces for three animal families \u2013 mammals, birds, and reptiles \u2013 using Fence/Wall pieces to keep them separated. Watch out: different families cannot touch, and any attempt triggers a funny \u201cfight cloud,\u201d sending the last piece back to the conveyor.\n\nWith 30 levels split between the structured Urban Zoo and the organic Safari Sanctuary, Habitat Shapes offers short, accessible, and reversible challenges. Pick, rotate, and place pieces on the grid, experiment with undo and restart, and find the perfect layout of space and barriers. Each move brings small victories and satisfying moments without time pressure, letting you enjoy a flawlessly organized zoo.\n\nPerfect for fans of spatial organization, subtle visual humor, and puzzles that reward smart experimentation.",
