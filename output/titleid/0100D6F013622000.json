	"description": "Learn one of the world's hardest languages as you help Shu, Jin, and Kou save Genya from language-devouring Akuma!\n\nA retired samurai (\u4e3b, Shu) is entrusted with saving his home from intelligent, language-devouring \"Akuma\" alongside an eccentric fox (\u4eba, Jin) freed from a cursed abode and an astute princess (\u516c, Kou) with her own ambitions.\n \nShujinkou is a dungeon-crawler that offers a unique opportunity to learn Japanese as you play. In addition to being a full-fledged JRPG, it features thousands of Japanese words, phrases, kana, kanji, and grammar elements that players can master through focus, diligence, and consistency. The language content offers new knowledge for language learners of any level.\n \nLearning Japanese is entirely optional. For those more interested in the adventure, Shujinkou delivers a rich role-playing experience:\n\u2022 Explore challenging labyrinths and solve puzzles from a first-person perspective.\n\u2022 Engage in strategic turn-based battles that evolve over time.\n\u2022 Switch to \u201cEnglish-Only\u201d mode at any time to focus solely on the gameplay experience.\n\u2022 Master hundreds of Arawasu skills and uncover powerful items.\n\u2022 Forge dozens of distinct weapons and armor, each with unique flavor text.\n\u2022 Fish for a wide variety of marine creatures at various scenic spots.\n\u2022 Complete 100 side quests that explore and expand upon the many inhabitants of Genya.\n\u2022 Play six minigames hosted by members of the Fuu Lobby.\n\u2022 Revisit your journey through the Art Gallery and Jukebox.\n\nHaving been in development for over six years, what truly sets Shujinkou apart is its additional, seamless integration of Japanese language learning.
