	"description": "You play as Jesse Fox who finds himself imprisoned in a covert military base where he was arrested for a crime he didn't commit. Jesse must now escape using his dry wits, quick words, improvised skills, arsenal of warfare, violent explosives, MacGuyvered gadgets, and an elaborate explanation of how it all went down. If that all fails, he'll use his fists.\n\n\u2022 Uncover a clandestine plot as you escape from an enemy base where you were imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit.\n\u2022 Modern gameplay mechanics that pay homage to a solid classic.\n\u2022 Gain experience and skills by utilizing stealth to take down your enemies.\n\u2022 Deceive, adapt, and do whatever is necessary to escape\u2026 even if you have to impersonate a cat.\n\u2022 Enjoy the thrill of interrogation as you elaborate specifics of your great escape to a lieutenant who seeks to scrutinize Jesse's every word in an intricate report.\n\u2022 Decipher a plethora of satirical culture, gaming and movie references. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll fall in love with them.\n\u2022 Collect an arsenal of classic gear, things that go \"pew-pew\", maybe a thing or two that goes \"BOOM!\", and some things that go \"BOING!\", and definitely a thing that goes \"SCRATCH\".\n\u2022 Does this smell like chloroform to you?",
