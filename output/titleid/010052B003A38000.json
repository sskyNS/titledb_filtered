	"intro": "The Long Reach is an adventure game filled with colourful characters, puzzles, and a shock of discovery. Wait, weren't we supposed to say, \u201cjoy of discovery\u201d? That can\u2019t be right.",
	"description": "The Long Reach takes place in New Hampshire, in the fictional town of Baervox. The game draws its inspiration from Lone Survivor and The Cave and all the classical adventures (except that The Long Reach is set in the present day). You don't play in a post-apocalyptic world or explore a fairy-filled fantasy world. You\u2019re in the thick of it, just around the corner from the place where you buy your groceries.",
