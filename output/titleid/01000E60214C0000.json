	"description": "GOST of Time is an absurdist top-down action and puzzle game with time-traveling mechanics.\n\nWelcome to a distant and absurd future where even time is subject to government regulations. In this glorious era of progress, an elderly citizen requires vital medication. He acquires a government-approved Time-Clone\u2122 device for pill delivery. The process is, as always, efficient and precise - to get the pills, he must clone himself and send the clone into the machine, where it solves puzzles, retrieves the pills, and travels through time.\n\nYou play as the clone, created to serve a greater purpose. Your job is to face challenges, bypass obstacles, and solve puzzles to retrieve the pills for the old man. Every time you go back in time, you'll encounter your past self, repeating all your actions exactly. By working with your past selves, you solve puzzles to get the pill. Remember: you're your best ally and worst enemy!\n\nFeatures:\n- Time-traveling mechanics: play with your past selves.\n- Collect ancient artifacts from the Old Era.\n- Hemoglobin, pixel violence, and dark humor.",
