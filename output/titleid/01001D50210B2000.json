	"description": "Embark on a terrifying journey in Backrooms Horror Escape, a horror game that traps you in a nightmarish maze where reality warps and sanity crumbles. Lost in the Backrooms, a claustrophobic labyrinth of decaying office spaces and flickering fluorescent lights, you must navigate through endless corridors and damp, stained carpets, all while battling the creeping fear of the unknown.\n\nArmed only with a camera, your goal is to document eerie sights and sounds as you move deeper into the maze. The camera not only serves as a recording device but as a tool to uncover clues and reveal the sinister entities that stalk you. Each photo or video clip may hold vital information\u2014sometimes even exposing the true horrors lurking in the shadows.\n\nAs you venture further into the twisted maze, the Backrooms begin to warp your perception of time and space, with every corner leading to new, unsettling dangers. Solve intricate puzzles, avoid terrifying creatures, and keep your sanity intact as you race against time to find the elusive exit.\n\nThe deeper you go, the more the maze changes. Will you escape before your mind unravels, or will you become another lost soul trapped forever in the endless void of the Backrooms?",
