	"description": "Feature 1: Simple Yet Deep, Lively Battles\n\nThe basic system is a classic 2D tower defense game where you summon characters from your base and march them forward to destroy the enemy's base to win. While the controls are simple, the gameplay is profoundly deep. With over 65 characters, each possessing a variety of abilities like ally healing support and self-destruct attacks, skillful combination and flexible formation are key to enjoying the game.\n\nAdditionally, there's an element inspired by parades called the 'Symphony Effect,' where various effects are activated based on the musical instruments played by the characters in march. This adds further strategic depth to the formation of your parade squad and the order of their summoning.\n\nFeature 2: Comprehensive Development Elements\n\nIn addition to leveling up and limit breaking, there is a 'Skill' system that allows you to add special abilities not available through regular development. Since you can add up to three types of skills to each character and select them carefully, you can enjoy a unique development process! Furthermore, since you can reset levels and get a full refund of the coins spent, it allows for more freedom in restructuring formations and character development.\n\nFeature 3: No Gacha Purchases, No Stamina System\n\nThe scout gacha, which allows you to acquire characters, can be used by consuming tickets obtained within the game, with no additional purchases required. Also, as there is no stamina system, you are not bound by time and can play as much as you like, whenever you like.\n\nMoreover, the scout gacha allows you to choose from two randomly selected character candidates, enabling players to make selections based on their strategy or preference rather than leaving it entirely to chance.\n\nFeature 4: Take a Break with Various Talents and Mini-Games in the Office\n\nWhen you return to the office, the home screen, you'll be greeted by newly recorded voice lines from Harusaki Nodoka, a staff member of hololive. In the office, talents from hololive may also make appearances, and you might witness some unexpected interactions.\n\nAdditionally, mini-games with gameplay entirely different from the main story have been implemented. These games allow you to collect coins necessary for character strengthening. For now, the mini-games titled \"Hurry Up! Miko-Chi!\" and \"Dancing Subaru\" are available. In \"Hurry Up! Miko-Chi!\", Sakura Miko (a VTuber affiliated with Hololive), who has overslept, dashes at full speed towards her destination while avoiding obstacles. \n\n\u25a0 New Features for the Nintendo Switch\u2122 Version\nThis version includes all DLC!\nEnjoy the full HoloParade experience!",
