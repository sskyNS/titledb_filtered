	"description": "On a faraway planet Dobo is a worldly renowned hero. He\u2019s inspired the work of millions of people.\nBut something very serious happened. Dobo has lost that sparkle in his eyes and, little by little, started to get stuck in his own thoughts, creating blockings, shutting himself in a dark room.\nAfter a short time, Dobo didn\u2019t seem the same anymore, but few could see him, because he set himself apart from everybody else.\nFortunately his family, especially his grandchildren, are making an effort to get him out of his dark room and bring him back to life.\n\n- Online ranking for each mission;\n- 45 missions;\n- Challenging puzzles;\n- Pixel art;\n- End when completing the game.",
