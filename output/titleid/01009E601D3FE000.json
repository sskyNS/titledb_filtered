	"intro": "Will you be able to guide these 2 robots through intricate puzzles full of traps? It will not be easy to overcome the 42 levels that separate them from freedom.",
	"description": "TROM is a challenging puzzle video game with pixel art aesthetics where two robots, with the most advanced AI, prepare to venture on an exciting journey to freedom by escaping from their captors.\n\nInspired by the mythical arcade games of the 90s, TROM will test your skill and patience at the controls. Thanks to the split screen, it offers ingenious traps that require coordination and cunning to overcome. Controlling both robots simultaneously, players must creatively navigate challenges and guide the automatons to their final bases.\n\nWith an arcade approach and a focus on escaping labyrinthine courses, TROM invites players to explore the connection between themselves and the robots as they face each obstacle with ingenuity.",
