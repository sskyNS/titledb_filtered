	"description": "Unto Deepest Depths is a turn-based strategy game where all units must move and attack every turn. Build your party, upgrade your units, and lead them into the unknown to vanquish the horrors below in this punishing roguelite where any move could be your last.\n\nChallenging turn-based combat with a twist\n\nBattle through tactical turn-based combat where death is always just around the corner, made more challenging due to a simple rule: Every turn, units must move and attack. No waiting for enemies to come to you, and be mindful of your more destructive units - they may take down a few allies if you're not careful.\n\nBattle powerful, dark foes\n\nVenture across the land and into the depths below to fight off corrupt, menacing creatures not of this world. Powerful bosses, life leeching enemies, and more await you in the depths.\n\nBuild your party\n\nGain XP through battles and events and spend it to hire, promote, and upgrade units as you see fit to build a powerful party.\n\nFeatures\n- Build and grow your party with a variety of unit types and specialties. Elite and specialized units can be unlocked by promoting units with the XP earned from battle.\n- Grow your units with powerful upgrades, but choose wisely as not everyone can specialize in everything.\n- Battle through procedurally generated conflicts set across five unique biomes as you venture further into the depths below.\n- Face powerful bosses and elite enemies along your journey.\n- Choose your path and respond to unexpected challenges and events as you venture forth.\n- Unlock additional difficulty levels, powerful upgrades, and unique starting parties as you play the game.",
