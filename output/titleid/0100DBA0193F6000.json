	"description": "A short story about what sort of challenges everyday little things can be. Help the girl buy milk, be the first not to disappoint her.\n\nThe game is a small visual novel, showing either funny abstraction and wordplay or painful psychological episodes. The claim that history is based on real events will be too specific, so it is easier to pretend that it is just a set of abstractions and wordplay.\n\nFirst of all, this is an artistic manipulation with word and form, only then - a game.\n\nThis product includes both the first and the second part of the series: \"Milk Inside A Bag Of Milk Inside A Bag Of Milk\" and \"Milk Outside A Bag Of Milk Outside A Bag Of Milk\".\nGAME FEATURES:\n\u2022 Psychedelic narrative full of pyramidal verbal constructions.\n\u2022 Stylized pixel graphics which reflect the girl's distorted perception of the world.\n\u2022 High variability: each playthrough is unique. However, some dialogue lines, images and scenes have only a small chance of appearing; you'll have to really get close to the girl in order to find out everything she hides.\n\u2022 Oppressive and viscous soundtrack.\n\u2022 Unique graphic style\n\u2022 Authentic audio solutions",
