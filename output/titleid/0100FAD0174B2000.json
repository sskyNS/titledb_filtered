	"description": "You\u2019re the newest resident at Ye OLDE retirement community, where you\u2019ll meet a cast of sexy seniors who are all dying (not literally) to meet you. It\u2019s a lot like summer camp, but with orthopedic shoes, bridge clubs, and more jell-o. It\u2019s an adjustment as you settle in, but who knows: maybe these will turn out to be the best years of your life!\n\nAdventure, passion, and transformation are not experiences reserved for the young. Later Daters portrays the aging process as a rollicking romp and reminds us of what the elderly can teach us about our capacity for love.\n\nRemember if the chairs are a-rockin' don't come a-knockin!\n\nGameplay Features:\n\nPlay as a sexy senior! Customize your look, name, romance history, and gender.\nHave some intimate adventures that deal with mortality, vulnerability, and getting some action.\nEnjoy LGBTQ inclusive romance and poly relationship options.\nPick your favorite companion creature : A cat, a dog... Or a robot?\nDate and flirt with eight fetching residents of Ye OLDE... \n",
