	"description": "Designed to find its sweet spot among families and infants, you will have great moments with Fear of Traffic. With its colorful world and a magical soundtrack, you will play in this game where your mission will be that of finding the way out, avoiding blocked roads, animals, odd objects on the way and dramatic accidents with other drivers. You can try to ramp up your score finding hidden collectibles in every level. Because it is at this time that you should have really fear of traffic.\n\nAt the start of the game the user will find himself in an extremely big map, free to be explored in each and every corner. At mid-screen, the player\u2019s car will be displayed. You will have to avoid pedestrians, cars and obstacles in order to not fail the level. In the top-left corner, the distance from the target can be found. Every level will have its own score, that will add up to every other level\u2019s. It is specifically designed for short but intense plays. The user is then challenged to repeat those levels with the goal of setting a new high score, maybe enjoying the company of other players competing against each other to earn the \u201cwinner\u201d title.",
