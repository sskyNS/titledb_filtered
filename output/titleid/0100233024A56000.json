	"description": "Step into the sharp mind (and quick paws) of a samurai cat in training! In Temari Trials, you'll solve logic-based block-pushing puzzles, pushing temaris to unlock chests and prove you're ready for the warrior's path.\nWith pixel art visuals and grid-based gameplay, it's easy to learn but hard to master. Each level challenges your thinking \u2014 and if you make a mistake, don't worry: you can undo as many times as you like. Precision is part of the training!\nThe game features 30 levels across two charming settings: the calm of a traditional Japanese forest and the disciplined atmosphere of the region's grand Dojo. As you advance, the puzzles become increasingly complex, demanding attention and strategy.\nIf you love classic puzzle mechanics, cozy environments, and a feline hero perfecting the art of the perfect push, Temari Trials will capture your mind \u2014 and your heart.",
