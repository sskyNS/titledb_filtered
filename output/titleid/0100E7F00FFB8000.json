	"description": "Resolutiion is a fast-paced action-adventure created by two angry German brothers leading a band of vagrants who loaded it with lovely pixels, dirty jokes, deep ideas and badassemotional tunes for 20 hours of punishing combat, rewarding exploration, and layered storytelling. Will you be the player or will you be played? In the Infinite Empire nothing is as it seems.\n\nExplore a fractured future, gathering weird weapons and stories, to piece together the past: a friend betrayed, a family broken, worlds at war. \n\nTo solve the mystery of the Cradles take on a multi-cultural-mashup of cynical gods, emotional machines, zealots, luddites, and furry critters in a world that doesn\u2019t care if it confuses or kills you \u2014 oh hey, a kitty!",
