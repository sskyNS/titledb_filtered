	"description": "Have you ever wondered... what goes on inside the mind of an android?\n\nWELL, THE ENIGMA\u00ae CORPORATION invites you to step into the DREAMSCAPE.\n\nWith DREAMSCAPE, we can represent the mind of an AI through an interactive 3D environment that we can explore! Get to know your new AI best friend inside and out via the DREAMSCAPE terminal interface, as they help you through this simulation.\n\n\n[CAUTION]\nNote that a DREAMSCAPE is a reflection of an AI's mental state, and that exploring the mind of a contaminated AI could yield unpredictable results.\nHowever, there is no need to worry. as this recruitment exercise is only a simulation of what a real DREAMSCAPE would look like.\n\n\n[DESCRIPTION]\nTHE ENIGMA MACHINE is a first-person sci-fi horror puzzle game that aims to capture the obscurity and unpredictability of games of old, framed within an increasingly unsettling presentation.\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 A unique fusion of glitchy mid-90's 3D graphics and VHS effects with more modern graphical effects for a distinctive visual style.\n\u2022 A series of puzzles which force you to think outside the box.\n\u2022 A blend of traditional first-person controls combined with point-and-click mechanics for satisfying interaction with the world.\n\u2022 A story that could only be told through the medium of games\n",
