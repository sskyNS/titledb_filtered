	"description": "Finally, on the Nintendo Switch, a game that lets your child enjoy studying while challenging their skills in math has entered the world of gaming. It contains a collection of division problems and math drills learned at the elementary level. There are up to 10 steps of learning, starting from problems using times tables within Elementary 3rd grade level range to developing skills such as calculating the remainders of 2-digit division problems and more. Advancing through the levels, your child can naturally become able to solve 3-digit by 2-digit division problems with ease.\n \nThe Story (setting)\n\u201cThe name\u2019s Greco. I\u2019m sendin you an invite to face the challenges that await in my castle! So, let\u2019s play a game!! I live at the very top of my castle! Do you got what it takes to reach me? It won\u2019t be easy. In order to get to me, you gotta pass through several rooms. In these rooms, you\u2019ll have to solve division problems to pass. That\u2019s why my castle is called the Calculation Castle! Moreover, my castle is full of ghosts with many tricks standing in your way, so good luck and do your best! If you manage to beat my ghostly henchmen and get through the rooms, you\u2019ll receive lots of hidden rewards\u2026but can you do it? I guess I\u2019ll wait and see! Heh heh heh\u2026\u201d\n \n\u2022 The game is composed of a series of stages and there are ghosts and locked doors within each stage. Greco and his ghosts will present the player with problems that they will need to solve in order to defeat the ghosts, unlock the doors, and proceed to the next stage.\n\u2022 The player can face off against and defeat ghosts. Doing so will earn the player treasures(items) and ghost coins which can be used to reveal hints and unlock special bonus stages.\n\u2022 Your child can happily play while studying math and develop stronger skills regarding division after some time.\n \nLearning System (Game Contents)\n[Select Problem]-----Players answer the questions by choosing the correct answer of the question from a series of numbers shown using cards.\n\u2022 Choosing the correct number will cause the ghost to take damage, reducing its HP(health points) by a set amount and earning the player some ghost coins.\n\u2022 If the player reduces the ghosts HP to 0, the ghost will be defeated, and the player will receive items and ghost coins.\n\u2022 By selecting and pushing [Hint] the player will be able to see a hint that can aid them in solving the question. Choosing to reveal a hint will require the player to spend ghost coins.\n[Unlock ]-----Remove the lock hung on the door by using the correct answer to the problem.\n\u2022 If certain conditions are met and the numbers on the lock match with the numbers of problems solved correctly, then the lock will be removed.\n\u2022 If all the locks on a door are removed then the door will open, and the player can advance further through the game.\n\u2022 By selecting and pushing [Hint] the player will be able to see a hint that can aid them in solving the question. Choosing to reveal a hint will require the player to spend ghost coins.\n [Bonus Stage]-----By acquiring the required item or \u201ckey\u201d, the player can advance to a special bonus stage.\n\u2022 In this game mode, players must defeat as many ghosts as possible within the time limit.\n\u2022 When the player exterminates ghosts, they will receive ghost coins.\n \nSo, let\u2019s aim for the final stage where the decisive battle with Greco awaits! A game that lets your child enjoy learning and studying math is coming to the Nintendo Switch. Greco and his ghosts are waiting for the next challenger!\n\nWith Nintendo Parental Controls, you can utilize your smart phone to monitor your child\u2019s activities. For example, the feature can be used in such a way that for every hour your child spends playing a game, you can encourage them to play a study game, such as Greco\u2019s Calculation Castle, for 30 minutes. So, how about deciding the rules with your child?",
