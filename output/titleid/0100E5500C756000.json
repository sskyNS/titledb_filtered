Visit the jungle, temples, beaches and a lavalicious volcano! \n\nOther-foodly activities\nTo appease Hoochooboo, you need to do more than cook.

In multiplayer each chef can choose a different ability to fit their personal cooking style.\n\nFoodfest or Foodfight\nCook your way through hell\u2019s kitchen solo or with up to 4 chefs. Challenge each other to foodfights in PvP! With so many chefs in the kitchen, chaos is sure to follow.",
