	"description": "* Relax at the beach and find every type of shell *\n\nEach shell is different, pick up and examine the ones that catch your eye. Rare shells need certain conditions to appear, can you solve the mystery? Try to collect the biggest and smallest of each species, while enjoying our calming music system and wave ambience.\n\n* Fill the pages of your journal *\n\nLearn all about the creatures who lived inside the sea shells, in fascinating descriptions written by marine biologist and author, Dr Helen Scales. Discover lovely hand drawn shell sketches for every new shell you find.\n\n* Playtime *\n\nSeashell will take between 1 and 2 hours to fully complete. Even after you\u2019ve found every shell, there is still a challenge! Gain all 10 research level badges and become a Friend of the Sea. \n\n* From the Team * \n\nWe\u2019re a team of just two developers who wanted to try something different. Though Seashell is far from a huge game filled with features we\u2019re very proud of what we\u2019ve made. You can play our game for cheaper than a beachside fish and chips, and if you find it relaxing, interesting and fun, nothing would make us happier than to hear about it. Thank you so much for taking a look at our game, and enjoy your time with the sea!",
