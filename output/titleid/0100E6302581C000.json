	"description": "This title is a remake of Xanadu, a real-time action RPG released by Nihon Falcom in 1985, released 10 years later in 1995. Players become adventurers, exploring all 10 stages while fighting monsters, with the ultimate goal of defeating the King Dragon.\n\nCombat uses a symbol-encounter system. Touching a monster triggers a battle scene where you fight with weapon attacks (body slams) and magic. Defeated enemies drop treasure chests with items and money. Monsters are finite and will not reappear if you hunt them all.\n\nThe growth system powers up weapons and magic with use. Characters have no professions, but gain Warrior or Wizard experience/levels based on how they defeat enemies. Weapons, armor, and magic also gain individual experience, becoming more effective with use. Since monsters are finite, your management skills are crucial for developing characters and items.\n\nRevival Xanadu II is an entirely new version with changes to the map layout, half of the monsters replaced, and revised parameter balance. As the manual states, \"Even Xanadu experts must find their own new playstyle,\" resulting in a game that's far from straightforward.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
