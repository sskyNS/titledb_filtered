	"description": "NEON INFERNO is a hybrid side-scroller and gallery-shooter where the action takes place in both the foreground and the background. As warring factions battle for control of a dystopian New York City, you enter the fray as an assassin for the Family -- a notorious crime syndicate determined to eliminate its rivals and dominate the metropolitan battlefield. Rendered in beautiful pixel art and backed by an evocative soundtrack, Neon Inferno delivers a stylish, modern 2D action experience with cyberpunk flair.\n\nSELECT YOUR KILLER \nTake control of Angelo Morano or Mariana Vitti and battle through the streets, blasting, deflecting, and slicing your way through your enemies! With multiple upgrades and weapon options to choose from, you'll be well-equipped to shift this city-wide conflict in your favor.\n\nSHOOT CLOSE, AIM FAR \nAlong with traditional run-and-gun action, you'll be able to attack your enemies in both the foreground and the background, deflect their projectiles back at them using \"Bullet Time\", and commandeer vehicles to chase down your targets! Choose your level of difficulty or challenge yourself in the 1-credit-clear Arcade Mode!\n\nA JOINT OPERATION \nGrab a friend and expand The Family's reign across the city together! With double the characters and double the firepower, there's no limit to the carnage you can cause!\n\nTARGETS ACQUIRED \nGo up against a rogue's gallery of unruly bosses, one at the end of every mission. Each boss is totally unique, featuring many attacks and multiple phases that will truly put your skills to the test!",
