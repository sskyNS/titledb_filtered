	"description": "ACHTUNG!\nYou are an American soldier. One of the distinguished 101st Airborne Division. Soldiers of 101st fought hard and died but they followed orders. They made things that others couldn't. Do you want to be remembered? You'll have to earn it. Your companions have captured the German bunker during the Battle of Normandy, and your task is to defend it at all costs. Defend your bunker! It won't be easy though.\n\nSoldiers are humans and between fighting, they need to rest, get fed, and regain their energy. The enemy won't wait for you to get ready. The day is short. Many tasks await you. Prepare food to regain some strength.\nThe sky is full of enemy aircrafts. It's hard to get enough supplies from your allies. You must scavenge whatever you can to survive. Search the bodies of those killed in battle - sometimes you will even find chocolate! Remember to check the supply regularly as you must also take care of your companions. Order wisely and share food.\n\nIf you don't have enough bandages, food, or ammunition, send a message to the command with a request for a supply drop. It is mandatory to enter the password in the Morse code. Receive encrypted messages and anticipate your enemy's plans.\n\nThis is why you are here. Perform missions - be vigilant and make good use of your machine gun, anti-aircraft gun, and anti-tank cannon.\n\nRemember: Soldier's fate... never changes. You thought 101st Airborne Division got famous for nothing?",
