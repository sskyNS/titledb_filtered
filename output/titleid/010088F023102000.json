	"description": "Liuri wakes up, alone, deep inside a mine on an abandoned floating island. He doesn\u2019t know how he got there or why. There\u2019s only one thing to do: explore. \n\nA tribute to the timeless Sokoban genre, LABYBAN modernizes the puzzle game experience with an accessible, intuitive, and stimulating approach. Across more than 140 levels, each puzzle pushes the gameplay mechanics even further. \n\nTeleporters, slippery surfaces, conveyor belts... and many more surprises await! \n\nThe world of LABYBAN is made up of seven distinct biomes, each with a strong visual identity and unique gameplay mechanics. Some introduce new ways to play, while others combine and transform previous challenges, ensuring a smooth and varied progression. \n\nWill you manage to escape the island?",
