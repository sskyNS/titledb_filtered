	"description": "Urban Flow is a game about the subtle beauty of city streets filled with cars moving in perfect harmony. But such order does not happen all by itself - the city needs YOU to control the traffic lights and to make sure everything goes smoothly. That means no crashes, no jams. Everything will run perfectly - as long as you stay focused!\n\nImmerse yourself in a beautiful, hand-crafted, low-poly world to discover the enormous satisfaction of watching the hundreds of tiny, colorful cars flowing through the streets \u2013 all while listening to the chill, urban music.\n\nOver 100 levels, each with its own busy intersection. You have one job: operate the lights and keep it safe.\n\nParty Game (even if you party all alone!)\n-----\n Play by yourself or with friends in scalable drop-in, drop-out local co-op mode for two, three, or four players!\nYou can help your friends or be a little rascal and spread the chaos!\n\nAvoid accidents by paying close attention to special vehicles and to the other players. Special vehicles include the ambulance, which can\u2019t wait for long, and the tank \u2013 which will plow through anything in its way.\n\nDon\u2019t want to play the campaign?\n-----\n Try our score-based Endless Mode or the Chill Mode - where you play for as long as you want, no rush and no score - only you and the music. Urban Flow is designed to be a great single player experience!\n\nDiscover various environments and weather conditions. Play with touch controls, Pro Controllers or Joy-Con\u2122 controllers. Complete challenges and unlock rewards.\n\nBecome one with the flow. The Urban Flow!",
