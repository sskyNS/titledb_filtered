	"description": "The Game \u2013 Your Favourite Stew, Guaranteed!\nSo you want to know what\u2019s in Zombie Soup?\n\nOf course the main ingredient would be some awesome top-down twin-stick shooting with a moderate amount of the clich\u00e9 \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d story, add a pinch of puzzle-solving, sprinkle some classic hack-and-slash actions, and stir with all the deadly zombies and god-knows-what creatures, resulting in a satisfyingly intense and exciting gameplay experience!\n\nThe Background \u2013 In a Crooked Little Town\u2026\nWelp! Ricky's graduation trip took an unexpected turn when he arrived in this town, only to discover that its inhabitants had been turned into zombies!??\n\nIn order to rescue Ashley, a young girl he had also just met in this unfamiliar town, Ricky strolled into (or is thrown into?) an unexpected adventure, with the help of a mysterious talking skull named MC Skully. Waiting for him will be hordes of zombies, intricately designed challenges, and ridiculously tough bosses with some of the most absurd abilities.\n\nThe Combat \u2013 LOCK N\u2019 LOAD!\nWho knows! This town seems like a mega-arsenal!\n\nWhether you are a cool-headed sniper, close-quarters combat specialist, or grandmaster explosive engineer, you\u2019ll find plenty of fun in Zombie Soup. We have not only gathered \u201cconventional firearms\u201d such as rifles, sniper rifles, SMGs, shotguns, etc., but also a ton of melee weapons like machetes, axes, daggers\u2026 And, of course, there are explosives, too. In addition, we have also designed a wide variety of offbeat, special \u201cweapons\u201d \u2013 nail gun, pitching machine, fireworks launcher, and even railgun! So you can be armed to the teeth to brave the horde of zombies.\n\nWeapon Unlock \u2013 TOUGH challenges\nWhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger!\n\nRicky will encounter many carefully designed timed challenges throughout the adventure in addition to boss fights. Those challenges are TOUGH! However, upon completion, you will be able to unlock more powerful weapons. Remember, the harder the challenge, the stronger the reward!",
