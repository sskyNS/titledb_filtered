	"description": "CHAOS REIGNS AND BULLETS FLY\nBright, frantic and frenetic combat will keep you on your toes. Meet new threats on every floor and new challenges in every room. The mighty wizbot Mephisto is waiting at the top... do you have what it takes to topple them?\n \nUTILIZE AN IMMENSE ARSENAL\nMagic + Guns = Magic Guns. Don\u2019t rely on bullets alone, because magic just makes everything better. Arm yourself with guns that shoot lightning, snowballs, sawblades, giant fists, and more!\n \nBRING YOUR FRIENDS\nOne mage with a gun is good. Two is better. Three is a party. And four is a robot wrecking crew. There\u2019s safety in numbers. So grab your best buddies and some more controllers to retake the tower from marauding hordes of magic-infused robots!\n \nEACH ATTEMPT IS UNIQUE\nThe tower is endlessly changing. Each time you try to retake it the rooms have shifted, the enemies swapped, the danger different. Failure means you have to start all over again. Though you may not make it to the top it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have hours of fun trying!\n \nLEVEL UP TOGETHER\nThe party that levels together plays together, so no one ever feels underpowered or unable to contribute. Everyone votes on the next upgrade or ability. No one gets left behind in the race to the top. If one falls, they can be revived!\n \nFAMILY FRIENDLY\nPerfect for all ages and skills, NoReload Heroes makes sure everyone can contribute to the fight with simple controls, bright visuals and basic concepts. The ability to jump in and join the shenanigans means even Granny can have a go at fighting Mephisto!\n \nFIGHT THROUGH THE HORDES\nMake your way back up the tower to take your place as the rightful ruler and show those robots who\u2019s boss. You made them, you can break them. Get your guns and get shooting, there\u2019s no time to reload when you\u2019ve got to save the spire!\n\nThis game requires two control sticks to play. Each player needs a pair of Joy-Con\u2122 controllers or a Pro Controller.",
