This is your cue to find out more about Hebereke...if you can!\nAnd that's not all! The Japanese and Scandivanian manuals are also included in the game!\n\n\u2605About Hebereke\nHebereke is a game developed by Sunsoft in 1991.\nThe main character, Hebe, is a little creature with a unique manner of speaking. The comical universe of the game and its cute characters are what made it so popular back then.\nAnother reason for its popularity is its action maze-like design. The player must explore every corner of the map to find their way in this surreal universe. The soundtrack is also to be mentioned: in contrast to the surreal world depicted, the music is more down-to-earth and straight to the point.",
