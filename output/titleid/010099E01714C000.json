	"description": "Block-sliding brain teasers get a fantasy adventure twist in Slap the Rocks, a retro puzzler where you play a medieval treasure hunter with a sword and a penchant for knocking stones around! Presented in top-down pixel art style, Slap the Rocks features 30 levels to explore, each with a maze of stones, bushes and stumps, where your objective is to hit and slide the white rocks into holes to create a path to reach a treasure chest!\n\nTo clear each stage, you\u2019ll need to slice through bushes and carefully navigate the terrain. Position yourself next to a stone and slap it with your blade to make it slide across the field, where it will stop as it collides with rock walls or other obstacles. Moving the stones in straight lines, you will eventually line up with pitfalls in the ground and fill them with the fallen stone. Can you overcome the increasingly tricky levels on your way to victory and fortune?\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Slide stones across maze-like fields to cover pitfalls!\n\u2022 Flee from stumps and slice through bushes.\n\u2022 Claim treasure chests as your reward for solving each level!\n\u2022 Traverse 30 challenging stages of varied difficulty.\n\u2022 Retry any puzzle and discover multiple solutions!\n",
