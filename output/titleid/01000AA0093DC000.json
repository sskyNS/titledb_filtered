	"description": "\u201cDream Alone has a simple premise and a big atmosphere, with a background design that is genuinely chilling and puzzles that will make you think.\u201d 8/10, Pure Nintendo\n\nDream Alone is a 2D platforming game with classic platform gameplay, deadly traps, a dark storyline and unique hero abilities. \n\nA mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.\n\nThe hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. \n\nA mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! \n\nBy using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.",
