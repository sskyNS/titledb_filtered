Help ronin Tomoe to confront the ghosts of her past and to end the reign of violence of Shogun Akechi, her former master.\n\nUnique Non-Lethal Combat: Tomoe has sworn not to take another life, and must instead just disarm her enemies. Use a combination of counters and disarming ki-attacks to defeat the shogun\u2019s army.\n\nDepth and Customization: Find your own fighting style by making use of special ki techniques that allow for unique combos, as well as enhancements from crests and herb infusions you find across the land of Bakugawa. \n\nStriking Environments: Explore the sacred nature and mistreated districts of Bakugawa, where its society lives under a violent and corrupt military regime, isolated from the world and shattered by the terrors of its past wars.\n\nEmotional storytelling: Even as a coward and deserter through the eyes of her own people, ronin Tomoe returns to her former land after witnessing all the blood that a blade can shed, hoping to spark the hope and courage Bakugawa needs to fight back against its violent political methods.\n",
