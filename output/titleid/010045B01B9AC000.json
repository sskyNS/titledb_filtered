	"description": "Snowy valleys, Christmas bells and Santa Claus is preparing gifts for Christmas. A normal December. Really? No, something is different this year... Monsters and Zombies from all the world are trying to steal the gift packages, they want it all and they want it now. But Santa don't own just a sack full of gifts and a rod... he also has guns, big guns. Guns to defeat infinite waves of monsters to protect the gift packages. Help Santa to get rid of the evil breed and bring us happy holidays! \n\nHow to Play: \nThe primary weapon has infinite ammo, it is not very strong but always available. Shoot as many enemies as possible you can to earn money for purchasing new pistols, guns, and refill ammo in the shop. Pick up ammo clips and health packages to keep you alive while playing a level. On each level, you must fight against a big end monster to go to the next level. From level to level the game gets harder. - use arrows in the left side to work through the level - use the shot button on the right side to shoot - if you have purchased and picked a gun, switch between the new gun and the primary weapon.\n",
