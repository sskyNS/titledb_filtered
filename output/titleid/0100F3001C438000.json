SOLVE MORE THAN 100 LEVELS !\n\nUnique gameplay: Control your Quadroids simultaneously on four screens and make your way through more than 100 danger-filled levels. Jump to avoid acid baths, lasers, deadly spikes and other vicious traps, or strategically sacrifice your minions to create new platforming opportunities.\n\nQuadroids is simple to play, with just 4 buttons (one for each part of the screen), but can you master the ropes?\n\nSolo or multiplayer ? Ask for friends to control one or more screens if you're getting stuck with your own brain...\n\nQuadroids will rip your neocortex to shreds. Show that you're the boss and fight your way to the top of the leaderboard!",
