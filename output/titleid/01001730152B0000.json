	"description": "Plunder Panic is a team-based pirate fighting game for up to 12 players where two rival crews battle for supremacy on the high seas! Featuring both local and online play, work with your crew to steal treasure, defeat the enemy captain, or sink their ship. The first team to capture an objective wins the battle!\n\nInspired by classic SNES games and modern couch co-op games, Plunder Panic blends retro graphics, arcade action, team-based strategy and a boatload of game modes and modify-arrs that appeals to both casual and core game players alike. Two teams of up to six players each must go all hands on deck and face off against each other, utilizing a variety of weapons, enchanted items, and power-ups to achieve one of four victory conditions. Plunder Panic features flexible team configurations, from one to twelve players in a match, including local, online, and/or AI-controlled players. This makes Plunder Panic both the perfect casual party game and competitive eSports game.\n\nPlunder Panic has collected a treasure chest full of indie acclaim including winning the IndieCade Audience Choice Award, being a PAX Rising Showcase winner, being an official selection of the Indie MEGABOOTH, and being featured at SXSW, PAX East, PAX West, and PAX Rising Online.\n\nSo, it is time to assemble your crew, get all hands on deck and send your scurvy competition to Davy Jones\u2019 Locker!",
