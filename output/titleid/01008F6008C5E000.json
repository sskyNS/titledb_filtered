	"description": "Catch, battle, and train Pok\u00e9mon in the Paldea region, a vast land filled with lakes, towering peaks, wastelands, small towns, and sprawling cities. Explore a wide-open world at your own pace and traverse land, water, and air by riding on the form-shifting Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Miraidon. Choose either Sprigatito, Fuecoco, or Quaxly, to be your first partner Pok\u00e9mon before setting off on your journey through Paldea.\n\nChoose your own path as you strive for Champion Rank, take on Titan Pok\u00e9mon, and face off against Team Star\n\nThere is no set path on your Paldea adventure, so you can weave freely through your Treasure Hunt consisting of three grand stories. Along Victory Road, you will challenge Gyms in different locations and aim to achieve Champion Rank. On the Path of Legends, take on gigantic Titan Pok\u00e9mon that guard rare ingredients. And in \u2605 Starfall Street \u2605, you\u2019ll use the new Auto Battle feature to take on Team Star grunts from your school in order to reach their boss.\n\nEncounter Pok\u00e9mon that shine and glimmer thanks to the Terastal Phenomenon\n\nPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea region have the ability to Terastallize to take on a gemstone-like appearance and gain special power. Each Pok\u00e9mon has a Tera Type that remains inactive until the Pok\u00e9mon Terastallizes. For example, most Eevee will have a Normal Tera Type, but some other Eevee have a Water Tera Type! When a Terastallized Pok\u00e9mon uses a move that matches its Tera Type, the boost to that move\u2019s power will be even greater! Terastallizing holds the key to victory or defeat in battles in the Paldea region.\n\nExplore, trade, raid, and more with friends\n\nBand together with up to three friends* in the Paldea region. Along with series staples, such as trading** and battling** Pok\u00e9mon, you will be able to explore the various locations of the region in these games and have picnics with your friends and family. Keep an eye out for shining crystal-like structures where you can join Tera Raid Battles, a completely new battle format where you will team up with three other Trainers in order to take on a Terastallized wild Pok\u00e9mon within a time limit. Work together and you may be able to catch a defeated Tera Pok\u00e9mon. Collect, manage, and trade even more when Pok\u00e9mon HOME*** support comes to the Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Pok\u00e9mon Violet games.\n",
