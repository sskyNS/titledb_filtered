	"description": "The year is 2030. Business is as usual in the isolated research city of Rokumei\u2013that is until several explosions suddenly go off in the nuclear research facility known as \u201cLABO.\u201d The city sends in \u201cSirius,\u201d an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation only gets worse when LABO\u2019s nuclear reactor melts down, \u2013with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.\n\nThe key to survival lies in the player\u2019s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Your emotions projected upon the characters, particularly your trust in them, shape the progression of the story. Only with effective use of this system and completion of both protagonists\u2019 stories can the player piece together the truth.",
