	"description": "The sun had risen over the ancient civilization's city, yet the once vibrant and lively streets were now empty and quiet, filled only with the moans of the sick. The leaders gathered in their chambers, discussing the spreading sickness and their lack of a cure. They decided to send a little bird through a portal to search for a cure in other eras and that little bird is you!\n\nEnjoy a combat-free journey through colorful worlds! Lean back and enjoy the scenery and the sensation of flying. It is a great game for relaxing and calming down after an exhausting day full of hassle.\n\nMost levels can be finished quite quickly so that you can freely choose spend time exploring the environment but you don\u2019t have to stay for too long if you are just looking for a short moment of peace and enjoyment.
