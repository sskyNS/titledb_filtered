	"description": "Get ready for action with a vacuum so strong, even the laws of physics are nervous. Suck up everything in sight\u2014boxes, animals, enemies\u2026 basically, if it\u2019s not bolted down, it\u2019s going in!\n\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning. At the end of each level, it\u2019s payback time! Fire everything you\u2019ve collected straight at bosses, towers, and anything unlucky enough to stand in your way. It\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s vacuum justice.\n\nDodge obstacles, suck shiny gems, and unlock new vacuum styles that prove cleaning up can look cool too. The more you suck, the more fun it gets!\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Suck It All In \u2013 Enemies, crates... even elephants! This vacuum breaks records, physics, and probably warranty terms.\n\u2022 Epic Boss Fights \u2013 Giant enemies. Flying objects. Extreme chaos. Maximum satisfaction.\n\u2022 Smash Castles \u2013 No catapult? No problem. Your vacuum launches stuff like a pro.\n\u2022 Fun Skins \u2013 Vacuums shaped like gadgets, tools, or total mysteries. Is that one made of scrap? Maybe. Why not.\n\nNothing is safe from the Super Sucker! Seriously. Hide your stuff.",
