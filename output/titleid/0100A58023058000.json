	"description": "No Sun To Worship is a minimalist, stealth-action game that captures the brilliance of the first pioneers of the stealth genre and recreates their retro-aesthetic charm within an echo of a dying world.\n\nPunishment Delivered\nEach of 6 bite-sized chapters will challenge your art of infiltration and assassination by giving you freedom to approach the levels as you see fit. Sneak, crawl, disable surveillance and smash light sources to move undetected. Isolate and eliminate targets silently or start firefights on your own terms. Manage your resources wisely or be forced to get creative - The enemy doesn\u2019t need to know the gun aimed at their head is empty.\n\nEcho of a dying world\nDiscover your role and the broader canvas through environmental and non-verbal storytelling as you travel through an echo of a dying world, left in agony after a nuclear war with its inhabitants trying to stitch its broken pieces back together as the onlookers from another world observe in silence.",
