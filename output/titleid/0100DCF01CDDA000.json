	"description": "Spin the wheel and set off on an exciting adventure with your friends!\n\nDefeat monsters, purchase weapons, and level up, just like in an RPG. Once you've gathered enough strength, face off against powerful bosses in epic fashion! Your journey will take you across a wide, diverse world... Just don't forget that your true goal is to get filthy rich!\n\nMoney is everything! Anything goes, as long as it lines your pockets...and as long as you're cool with it! Will you walk the path of thievery and plunder, or will you hold firm to your morals? Will you join hands with your friends, or plot to betray them? It's dealer's choice around these parts!\n\nPlay even with faraway friends in Online Mode, and feel free to pause your adventure anytime with the Autosave function; it'll be ready and waiting for you whenever you're available again!\n\nThere's also a full range of display settings on offer, including HD and widescreen support, allowing full immersion like never before! Game too slow for you? No problem! Speed options up to 5x ensure you can always keep things moving along at your own pace. A virtually endless array of options allows you to play the game your way: you can substitute in battle BGM from earlier titles, set the number of weeks to play, adjust game balance, and more! You can even give yourself an advantage if you're new to the Dokapon experience; come one, come all, as this game's for everybody!\n\nThe Sword of Fury returns to cut through all the nonsense of the 2020s in style. Come grab its hilt and give it a swing for yourself!",
