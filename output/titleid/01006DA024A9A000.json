	"description": "Dig deep, collect valuable minerals, upgrade wisely, explore diverse locations, uncover ancient secrets, and try not to explode! Will you save the world or vanish in the depths below?\n\nABOUT THIS GAME\nThe Great War is over, and the Age of Diesel has come. While many believe this is an era of harmony and prosperity, you know that peace is more fragile than ever. You embark on a journey into the depths of Earth to find the means to avert future conflict. But what awaits you in the darkness below? Is it a boon or doom for humanity?\n\nTake control of a colossal mech, capable of drilling through hundreds of meters of rock in a matter of seconds. Collect valuable resources, then fly back to your base to sell minerals for immense profit. Keep a close eye on your control panel: in a dangerous environment, your mech may overheat or overcool, and, most importantly, it doesn\u2019t run on air \u2013 it needs fuel to operate. And beware of falling stones - your machine's hull won't withstand too much damage.\n\nRebuild your base\nYour base has seen better days, but with enough amount of money you will restore it to its former glory and beyond to enhance your mining performance and unlock special abilities.\nUpgrade your gear\nUpgrade every part of your mech individually to transform an outdated prototype into a technological marvel. Experiment with different builds to create the ultimate mining machine best suited for your playstyle.\n\nFind hidden secrets\nDiscover artifacts to unravel the history of the first human civilization on Earth, or search for the remnants of the previous underground expedition to unlock special upgrades with unique effects for your mech.\nExplore 8 diverse locations\nThe deeper you go, the more locations you will discover. Each has its own visual style, atmosphere, gameplay mechanics, and threats to deal with.\n\nSurvive earthquakes\nThe ground you dig does not stand still \u2013 it shifts, changing its terrain. An earthquake is a dangerous time to collect resources, but when it\u2019s raining minerals, how can you resist not grabbing some ore?",
