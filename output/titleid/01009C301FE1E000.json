	"description": "Released in 1986 in Japan, ZANAC is a vertically scrolling shooting game. Players pilot the ZANAC fighter to battle the runaway system. ZANAC utilizes both normal shots and special bullets to fight. There are eight types of special bullets, including omnidirectional bullets, penetrating bullets, defensive barriers, rotating bullets, vibration bullets, boomerang bullets, reactive bullets, and high-speed rapid-fire bullets.\n\nA highlight of the game is the \"ALC (Automatic Level of Difficulty Control)\" system. This feature adjusts the game's difficulty based on the player's playstyle, such as high rapid-fire rates or destroying fortresses. Since the game's progression changes with different playstyles, players can enjoy a fresh experience each time they play. Interestingly, certain enemies only appear when the difficulty increases, encouraging players to adjust their strategies for a deeper experience.\n\nAs a classic shooter from the 1980s and a pivotal title in the history of Compile\u2019s shooting games, ZANAC is a must-play for any shooting game enthusiast.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
