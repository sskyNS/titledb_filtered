	"description": "A packed international schedule awaits, including the oldest Test Match rivalry as Australia tour England, the Test Championship Final and the 2023 World Cup.\n\nCricket Captain 2023, the immersive gaming experience that takes you to the heart of professional management. Whether you're a seasoned cricket strategist or a newcomer to the sport, this game offers endless possibilities and challenges that will keep you hooked for hours on end.\n\nWith an extensive player database featuring real-world cricketers, you'll have the power to recruit, train, and nurture your own squad of talented players. Analyse their strengths, weaknesses, and form to create the perfect combination of batting, bowling, and fielding prowess. The decisions you make off the field will determine your team's success on the field.\n\nThe new aggression system, inspired by Bazball, uses batting ability and natural aggression based on the current batting tactic, rather than the type of match being played. A generation of cricketers brought up on 20 Over Cricket have naturally aggressive styles that mean many have higher one-day averages than first class. Batting aggressively to match their natural style can improve performance.  Equally, knocking runs off at 12 an over is natural to players in the last overs of a 20 over (or even Test) match.\n\nCricket Captain 2023 also includes historical data for international player rankings and player recent form, including recent performances in Test, ODI and 20 Over Internationals. International team ranking modeled using results of every match in the four-year window. Accurate wicket keeper statistics are also included, with separate fielding stats for keepers and outfielders, as well as byes conceded records. All domestic systems include the latest developments in India, South Africa and around the world.\n\nKey features for 2023 include:\n\u2022 Match Engine: new Bazball inspired player aggression and rating system.\n\u2022 International Team Rankings: calculated from last 4 years results.\n\u2022 International Player Rankings: with historical data, all-rounders and improved system.\n\u2022 Asia Trophy: play in ODI and 20 Over International tournaments.\n\u2022 Player Form: includes historical data, opposition and an updated system.\n\u2022 Recent Internationals: recent international player form graphs.\n\u2022 Wicket Keeper Statistics: keeper and outfield catches, byes conceded.\n\u2022 Wicket Keeper Ability: greater accuracy for keeping ability.\n\u2022 Stadium Model Updates: including new Perth stadium.\n\u2022 New South African Franchise League: six new teams.\n\u2022 Indian Domestic System: major update to all competitions.\n\u2022 Domestic System Updates: all systems updated to latest rules and formats.\n\u2022 Improved Player Generation: re-balanced with focus on player aggression. \n\u2022 New Kits: including international and Australian 20 Over.\n\u2022 Test and ODI Championships: updated for the 2023 season.\n\u2022 Tournament Modes: play in stand-alone One Day or 20 Over World Cups.
