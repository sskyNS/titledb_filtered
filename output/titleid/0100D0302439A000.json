At first, it was a simple investigation, but as I followed the clues, I realized everything was connected.\n\nExplore a vibrant modern-day city in India, where 2D and 3D art styles blend seamlessly. Stroll past food carts, dance stages, and busy bazaars, soaking up the sights, sounds, and spirit of India. Every street corner holds a potential lead, a valuable item, or an unexpected encounter.\n\nTrade, bargain, and uncover hidden clues from a cast of over 50 characters \u2014 each with their own secrets, needs, and personalities.\n\nHaggle like a pro to get what you need. Buy incense sticks, street food, Bollywood memorabilia and more, and trade them smartly to open up new conversations, gather intel, and move closer to solving each case.\n\nFit the clues you collect on an Evidence Board. By placing items, people, and other items in slots, you'll get closer to the truth.\n\nJump into fun mini-games scattered around the city, including street cricket and Bollywood dance-offs. Winning games means better bargaining power \u2014 and sometimes, vital clues.\n\nDetective Dotson is a charming indie game made in India!",
