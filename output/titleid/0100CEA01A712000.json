	"description": "Pine is an interactive and emotional short story told wordlessly through hand-drawn animation and music, designed to be played in a single sitting.\n\nIt follows the story of a woodworker grieving the recent passing of his wife. Now alone in the glade where they made their home, he attempts to move on.\n\nHis simple daily chores of tending to his garden or collecting wood for the next winter are interrupted by memories of the happy times they spent together. Desperate not to forget her, the woodworker captures these memories in beautiful carvings out of the wood he collects.\n\nPine is a story-driven game focused on accessible, engaging interactions that pull you into the woodworker\u2019s experience. Charming puzzles and mini-games celebrate the happy memories of their time together while deliberate chores underscore his challenges with moving on.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\u2022 The Insistence of Memory - As you help the woodworker complete his daily routine, the simple chores you\u2019ll guide him through are interrupted by reminders of his late wife.
