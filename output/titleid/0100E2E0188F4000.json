	"description": "Silent Sector is an old-school open world sci-fi RPG with frenetic battles, crude humor, loose morals and cows. Created with endless love; especially for fans of space pirates, sci-fi westerns and alien encounters!\n\nSilent Sector takes us to a remote part of the galaxy where several factions fight each other over the profits in a new gold rush - in pursuit of an extraordinarily valuable mineral called Eldorite.\n\nOur hero comes into this Wild West universe and very quickly loses both their ship and cargo. You must find a way to repay the debt and take your revenge against Admiral Zed. This truly miserable corner of the universe offers you a chance to try your luck at becoming a successful merchant, rich miner, feared mercenary or a famous adventurer.",
