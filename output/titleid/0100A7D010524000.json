	"description": "It\u2019s time for the flock to come back to the barn. Problem is, the path is full of dangerous traps: lakes, dense forests, cliffs, etc\u2026 As a sheepdog, it\u2019s your job to guide the flock and make sure it comes back safely.\n\nDraw a line with controllers or the touch screen to trace a path and push the sheep in one direction. Make sure to avoid obstacles so that no sheep gets lost. As a guardian dog, it\u2019s also your duty to make sure no member of the herd gets left behind.\n\nThe entire flock is depending on you and your skills.

But a sheepdog never gives up, so make sure to keep the flock in line.\n\nFeatures: \n\n- 45 levels with increasing difficulty.\n- Simple and addictive gameplay.\n- Colourful and adorable graphics.\n- New dogs to unlock.\n- Play with controllers or the touch screen.
