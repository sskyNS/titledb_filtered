With the help of your friends, realize your destiny, save Astoria, and unleash the strength you\u2019ve always had locked away. \n\nIn the original game, previously released only in Japan, Imperial Princess Excella was an unplayable character, but in the new \u201cRefrain Mode\u201d in Shining Resonance Refrain, both she and Dragonslayer Jinas can be added as party members for a new experience \u2013 just be sure to save this for your second playthrough to avoid any spoilers!\n\nDragons were long thought to be extinct, and because Yuma holds the ability to transform into the Shining Dragon, he was taken as a captive of the Empire. With the help of the Dragoneers, Sonia, princess of Astoria, pleads with Yuma to aid them in their fight to save their land from the Empire\u2019s dominion. Typically timid, will Yuma find the courage to realize the strength he has within him?",
