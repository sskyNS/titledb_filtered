	"intro": "The MSX2 Version of \u201cPuyo Puyo\u201d,  known as \u201cOld Puyo\u201d and \u201cPrototype Puyo\u201d is here.\nThis is the origin of the classic puzzle game!",
	"description": "This action puzzle game was released in Japan by COMPILE in 1991. Players control two-Puyo pairs, clearing them by connecting four or more of the same color horizontally or vertically. Piling Puyo to the top results in a game over. This title is the definitive action puzzle, featuring chain clears and nuisance Puyo attacks in versus mode.\n\nThe game offers two types of play: 1 Player, which you can enjoy alone, and 2 Player, for battling a friend. The 1 Player mode includes ENDLESS and MISSION game modes, as well as play utilizing items like CARBUNCLE and BIG PUYO.\n\nAs this title predates the focus on skits and characters before versus matches, fans sometimes call it \"Old Puyo\" or \"Prototype Puyo.\" It's a valuable title to experience the origin of the ongoing Puyo Puyo series.\n\n\n",
