	"description": "Control a sine wave and avoid obstacles in more than 40 levels.\n\nSine is a competitive arcade game with unique mechanics and compelling visuals. You control a sine wave, avoiding obstacles, racing to the finish, and collecting orbs scattered throughout levels ranging from simple to painfully difficult. The intuitive one-finger controls are easy to learn, but hard to master.\n\nEach level has three goals. In order to get 100% completion, you'll need to:\n  - Complete the levels\n  - Beat them within strict time limits\n  - Collect every orb\n\nKey Features\n  - A unique mix of genres and gameplay mechanics you've never seen before\n  - Beautiful, minimalist visual design\n  - Over 40 hand-crafted levels providing hours upon hours of gameplay\n  - Immersive beats and audio created just for Sine (headphones recommended!)\n  - Easy to learn, but challenging to master one-finger controls\n\nAwards\n\"1st place, GDS Indie Expo 2019\"\n\u2013 Game Developers Session 2019, Prague, Czech Republic\n",
