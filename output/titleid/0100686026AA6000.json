	"description": "You were supposed to be on a calm trip home after a relaxing vacation. But fate had other plans. A massive landslide has blocked the main route, leaving you trapped in an isolated area with only one option: find a detour and escape.\n\nNow you must brave the unknown, face unpredictable terrain, and rely on your skills to survive. In RV Drive There, speed doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 careful planning and smart decision-making are key. One RV, one detour, and a group of travelers you must manage and guide as a single unit to reach the exit.\n\nFeatures:\n- Tools & interaction: Use planks, a drill, and a winch to clear obstacles and pull the RV out of stuck situations.\n- Fuel & repairs: Your vehicle can break down anytime \u2014 repair it on the spot and keep an eye on fuel levels.\n- Diverse environments: Travel through forests, mysterious caves, and snowy roads, each with unique challenges.\n- Unpredictable events: Landslides, rough terrain, and sudden fuel shortages force quick decisions.\n- One way out: Only one detour leads home; mistakes can leave you stranded.\n\nThe RV won\u2019t move on its own. Without patience, planning, and precise execution, every stop could be the end of the journey. Face the challenges, navigate the detour, and prove that no trap can stop a true traveler.",
