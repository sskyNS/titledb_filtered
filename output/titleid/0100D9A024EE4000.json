	"description": "The city belongs to the night, but it doesn\u2019t forgive mistakes.\n\nYou are a vampire on the run, hiding among streets, dark alleys, and forgotten places where danger and desire walk side by side. \n\nEvery night brings new choices, new encounters, and new risks.\n\nIn Vampire Girls Love Story: Date or Die, time is always moving forward. Days pass. Hunters get closer. And the girls you meet are drawn to something they can\u2019t quite explain.\n\nSome are intrigued by your presence.\nOthers sense the danger beneath it.\nAll of them can change your fate.\n\nThis is a narrative visual novel where romance and survival are tightly connected.

Learning new skills, choosing when to fight or flee, and deciding how to spend each night can mean the difference between freedom\u2026 or the end.\n\nSome relationships offer safety.\nOthers grant power.\nAnd a few may cost more than you\u2019re willing to lose.\n\nBalance desire, strategy, and survival in a story where every choice carries weight.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\u25cf ROMANCE & SURVIVAL VISUAL NOVEL: A story that blends dating, danger, and supernatural tension.\n\n\u25cf TIME PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Days advance as you explore, shaping events, encounters, and threats.\n\n\u25cf CHOICE DRIVEN GAMEPLAY: Decisions affect relationships, abilities, and how the city reacts to you.\n\n\u25cf VAMPIRE HUNTERS & ESCAPES: Avoid pursuit, face danger, and fight to stay alive.\n\n\u25cf MULTIPLE ROUTES & ENDINGS: Different romances, powers, and outcomes based on how you play.\n\n\nDate wisely.\nSurvive the night.\nPlay now!",
