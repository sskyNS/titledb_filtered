	"description": "INTRODUCTION\nHave a Blast is a high energy, kinetic, multiplayer party game. Battle through the most ridiculously hazardous corners of the galaxy and use your surroundings to your advantage. Outmaneuver your frenemies and shatter them into colorful bits. \n\n\nARENAS\nBattle around the galaxy in fifteen arenas, with new ones coming. Classic asteroids, icy comets, mythical monsters, curious contraption, it is all there for you to chart a route before the match. Each arena puts you in perils, which you can turn into opportunities and use to your advantage \n\nSHIPS\nAll the ships in Have a Blast are small and nimble, enabling you to navigate the busy arenas. Each of the five ships has a unique powerful ability, requiring a slightly different approach. But even the strongest attacks can be countered, and it is never too late to turn the tide of battle to your side. \n\nGAME MODES\nDeathmatch \u2013 Last pilot standing wins the round in this familiar mode. Be the first to win five rounds and you win the match. \n\nTeam match \u2013 Any combination of players is possible in a team vs team play. Great opportunity to reinforce some friendships and ruin others. \n\nMothership \u2013 Keep your mothership safe and it will provide you with health, ammo and some refuge. Lose your mothership and you\u2019ll be toast very soon. \n\nChallenges - Try every ship and every environment by completing specific challenges against the computer. \n\n\nBOTS\nAdd bots to any match. Driven by a capable AI, they can provide some challenge when friends are not around; or you can use them to add energy to matches. If the adaptive AI gets frustrating or too easy, you can always adjust the challenge from the menu. \n\n\nWE HOPE YOU ENJOY OUR RETRO-INSPIRED MODERN-DESIGNED ARCADE!",
