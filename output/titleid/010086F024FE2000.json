	"description": "In Axobubble you control a friendly axolotl in a world of platforms and creativity. Your main ability is to create floating bubbles that act as temporary platforms. Use these bubbles to jump higher, cross dangerous distances, and collect shells while advancing to the big star shell at the end of each level.\n\nThe gameplay is accessible but full of possibilities. You can walk, jump and create bubbles and over time you will need to combine all these skills to overcome traps and reach hidden areas.\n\nThe game features 30 levels set on a mountain with challenges during both day and night. Early obstacles are simple like spikes and geysers. But be prepared because as you progress the environment gains dangers like crabs and saws requiring precise jumps and strategic use of bubbles.\n\nIf you like 2D platformers with a unique twist and levels that encourage creativity Axobubble is your next journey.",
