	"intro": "Ion Fury is a true old-school first-person shooter from legendary 3D Realms, publisher 1C Entertainment and indie studio Voidpoint, set in a cyberpunk metropole.",
	"description": "Shelly \u201cBombshell\u201d Harrison takes on a quest to slay evil transhumanist mastermind Dr. Jadus Heskel in the streets of Neo DC. She leaves a trail of carnage throughout huge, multi-path levels filled with gigantic explosions, more secret areas than we can count, and inhuman foes behind every corner. There\u2019s no regenerating health here; stop taking cover and start running and gunning.\n\nShelly\u2019s crusade to take down Heskel\u2019s army will see her leave destruction in her wake with a wide arsenal of weapons, complete with alternate fire modes and different ammo types.\n\nIon Fury laughs at the idea of mandatory checkpoints and straight paths through shooting galleries. But, just because this is a true old-school first-person shooter doesn\u2019t mean we've ignored all the good new stuff the last two decades have brought. Headshots? Hell yeah. More physics and interactivity? You betcha. 3DRealms, Voidpoint and 1C Entertainment have taken the best of both worlds and cooked it all into a bloody stew.\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022\tThe true successor to classic shooters such as Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood.\n\u2022\tExperience the original BUILD engine on steroids, pumped up and ready to rock again after 20 years!\n\u2022\tDuck, jump, climb, swim, and blast your way through 7 exciting zones packed with multiple levels of mayhem!\n\u2022\tA beautiful game world assembled from thousands of hand-crafted textures and sprites\n\u2022\tAn awe-inspiring arsenal of devastating weapons, including multiple ammo types and alternate fire modes. Tri-barreled revolvers, grenade launchers, and heat-seeking smart bombs are your best friends!\n\u2022\tThe classic '90s FPS action you love, meshed with modern inventions like locational damage and seamless level transitions\n\u2022\tZERO PROCEDURAL GENERATION. All levels are hand made and full of multiple paths, cool effects, and complex set pieces!\n\u2022\tThumping soundtrack comprised of true tracked module music, in authentic FastTracker 2 format",
