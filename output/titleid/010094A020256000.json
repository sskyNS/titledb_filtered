	"description": "ROPOKO for Nintendo Switch\u2122 is an interactive fiction-style adventure game. Players become the robot Ropoko and must escape from a maze-like laboratory with the help of \"Doctor.\" Learn words through conversations and use the vocabulary you've acquired to solve various puzzles!\n\nThe Nintendo Switch version is an enhanced adaptation of the original MZ-700 version, improving playability with features like word selection, auto-mapping, hint functions, and gamepad support, making it easy to enjoy in any play environment.\n\n\n- Gameplay\nThough interactive fiction games are generally considered high difficulty, we've designed ROPOKO to be accessible even for those unfamiliar with the genre.\n\nMovement is handled entirely with the Joy-Con\u2122, providing smooth navigation similar to action games or RPGs.\n\nIn traditional text adventure games, players input commands as keywords to direct the character's actions. In ROPOKO, only one noun is needed to issue commands. You don't need to input verbs or objects as in conventional games; just type a noun while in contact with the target to ask questions or use items.\n\nExamples: \"ropoko,\" \"laboratory,\" \"door,\" \"wire.\"\nOnly words encountered in previous conversations can be used, so increasing your vocabulary through repeated dialogue is key to progression. Commands can be entered either by typing directly on the keyboard or selecting words using a cursor.\n\nThe game includes various puzzles, mini-games, and complex dungeons to keep players entertained. After completing the game, you can aim for the shortest completion time or the highest vocabulary score.\n\n\n- About the MZ-700\nThe MZ-700 is an 8-bit computer released by SHARP in 1982. The original version was on this machine, which lacked graphic capabilities, so the game screen is entirely represented with character graphics (pseudo-graphics made from text). Large characters, which occupy two-thirds of the screen, move smoothly thanks to machine language programming. Although the sound source can only produce single-tone beeps, ROPOKO offers 12 background music tracks and 20 types of sound effects.",
