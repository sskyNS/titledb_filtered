	"description": "What's this about?\n\nSushi For Robots is a whimsical puzzle game about quirky robots and their insatiable cravings for sushi - how they actually process it is a mystery, but hey, if that makes them happy. As the seasoned chef of the favorite sushi venue in robot town, it\u2019s up to you to get the perfect dish in time for each of your picky patrons, placing the right stickers on the conveyor belts to change one tuna roll into a salmon nigiri.\n\nOk, ok, but how does it work?\n\nRobots are picky (and kinda goofy). Make sure they get their food in time! It's actually a pretty chill game. You can always press reset and try a different solution. Get creative! Use stickers to change the behavior of dishes and please your robotic clientele.\n\nPress play to see if your strange contraption can deliver food in time to the clients. And don\u2019t forget to take a break between challenges to listen to the conversation between three friends that come to your restaurant every week. Will they get involved in some convoluted plot? Absolutely not, these are just tiny stories about goofy robotic friends hanging out.\n\nCan I have some bullet points?\n\n- Sure.\n- Accessible puzzles that never get too long or convoluted\n- An open system that encourages experimentation and finding creative solutions.\n- Beautiful art that depicts an odd world where robots go to messy sushi restaurants.\n- A light-hearted narrative about friends that get together for their weekly dinner.",
