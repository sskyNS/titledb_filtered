	"intro": "Each Step Could Be Your Last!\n\nBrave adventurer Lance loved to party, but one night he ate too much and fell into a deep sleep. The vile Vizardians then stole his treasure and even took all his weapons, leaving only his giant spear. Lance entered the catacombs of death to confront the thieves and recover his lost possessions, but he soon realized why the spear was left behind: It barely fits in these cramped rooms!\n\n\nThe Right Moves in the Right Order\n\nIn this challenging dungeon adventure, each room is a brain-teasing puzzle with tight turns, deadly traps and no margin for error. All you need to do is jab every enemy with your giant spear to unlock the next door... but sometimes you can\u2019t even turn to face them, because the hallways are too narrow and the spear is too long. Sliding blocks, crumbling platforms, spiked floors... you\u2019ll have to plan your moves carefully if you expect to recover all of your stolen treasure.\n\nFEATURES\n\u2022 5 different stages with 170 unique rooms\n\u2022 Secret levels to discover\n\u2022 5 distinct enemy types\n\u2022 12 types of traps and obstacles\n\u2022 10 different ways to die\n\u2022 12 unlockable character skins\n\u2022 A special key that can be used to make levels easier to clear",
