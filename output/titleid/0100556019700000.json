	"description": "Get to know the curious hobby of a kitten named Sissa! She\u2019s a very organized feline, and when she plays with her balls of wool, each needs to be pushed across the floor to the correct spot. Presented in cute and colorful 3D style, Sissa\u2019s Path is a pushing puzzle game where you play as Sissa and move her toys around tiled floors.\n\nOnce all the balls of wool rest on the white circular tiles, the stage is cleared, and another increasingly complex hand-crafted puzzle awaits to challenge Sissa\u2019s toy-nudging skills. Can you help her organize her toys?\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Enjoy a relaxing  \"pushing puzzle\" experience!\n\u2022 Push balls of yarn onto target tiles to clear each brainteasing stage.\n\u2022 Navigate tricky maze-like levels in 3D isometric style!\n\u2022 Tackle progressively more difficult challenges and larger stages.\n\u2022 Retry as many times as it takes to find a solution!",
