	"description": "In Paint Path, every step is a brushstroke. This pixel-art puzzle puts you in control of a walking canvas that must cross hexagonal maps to reach the right painters. The atmosphere is charming and relaxing, with sound design tied to each painting action, creating a cozy and artistic experience.\n\nThe mechanics are easy to learn but full of possibilities: rotate and swap tiles to build the path, organize paint buckets, and make sure the canvas passes by the painters with the correct color. If you miss the sequence, the painting fails and the level is lost.\n\nThe color system is the heart of the game. Mix yellow, blue, and red, clean everything with white, or combine all three to create black. There are 6 possible variations, challenging you to plan the perfect path.\n\nWith 30 handcrafted levels, Paint Path starts in the Art Studio, where you learn the basics of painting and color logic. Then the challenge moves to the Art Museum, introducing multiple canvases, more painters, and tri-split tiles that demand even more creative strategies.\n\nCharming, smart, and full of surprises, Paint Path is the perfect puzzle for those who want to relax while thinking.",
