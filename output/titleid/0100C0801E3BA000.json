	"description": "April is a young woman living in England in the Victorian era. She has taken up a position as a housekeeper at the estate of Lord Ashford, a rather arrogant aristocrat who has recently inherited the mansion from his late father. With a wink to Pride and Prejudice the game requires April to clean up Lord Ashford's many rooms, interrupted by a dialogue with his Lordship.\n\nApril's Diary is a 3D puzzle game which applies a tile matching style of gameplay. You start in every room with a huge pile of items which are on top of each other and April needs to pick up 3 matching items every turn in sequence to clear them from the floor. This requires some strategy and skill.\n\nFeatures:\n- 3D puzzles\n- Uncover another mystery as you progress through the rooms\n- Victorian era style graphics and dialogue\n- Soundtrack my Martin F. Strauss ",
