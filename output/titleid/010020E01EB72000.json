	"description": "You are the Elder. You had a vision of a doomed future, so you took a handful of Pips, your fellow villagers, and led them to an empty valley to start anew. They need your guidance to survive the events foretold by the Prophecy, so make sure your Pips work hard!\n\ndotAGE has deep worker placement mechanics inspired by board games.\nBuild your village and assign your workers to their daily tasks, grow crops, herd animals, bury corpses, forge tools, upgrade buildings, train professionals, and produce dozens of resources.\nTake your time and think carefully before passing the turn!\n\nThe memories of the Elder are unclear, so each run will be different, with new buildings to discover. Play with more than 200 buildings, 30 professions, and 70 resources.\nAs you play, the memories of the Elder will come back, unlocking new game mechanics and content, such as new ailments, the mysterious VIPs, and new Elders!\n\nEach turn, the Domains, the forces that govern the world, will unleash increasingly powerful events on your village.\nFrom poison, to disease, to earthquakes, to kittens. Will you be able to survive them all and find out what is causing the apocalypse?",
