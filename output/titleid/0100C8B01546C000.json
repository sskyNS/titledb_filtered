If you hit a hazard, you\u2019ll instantly respawn at the beginning of the stage, adding to your death counter with each attempt. How many tries will it take for you to clear all 60 challenges?\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Roll and bounce through single-screen stages.\n\u2022 Master 60 levels of hardcore challenge!\n\u2022 Enjoy minimalistic greyscale presentation with a focus on tight gameplay.\n\u2022 Avoid spikes and other hazards!\n\u2022 Watch your death count climb in a rewarding loop of trial and error.\n\u2022 Respawn immediately to retry as many times as it takes!\n",
