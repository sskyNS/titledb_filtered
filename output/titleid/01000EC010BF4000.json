	"description": "Niche - a genetics survival game is a fresh blend of turn-based strategy and simulation combined with rogue-like elements. Shape your own species of cat/fox/bear/dog-like animals based on real genetics. Keep your animals alive against all odds, such as hungry predators, climate change and spreading sickness.\n\nKey Features:\n- Living, dynamic world to test your survival skills\n- Breeding system based on real genetics\n- Over 100 genes to shape your species\n- Procedural worlds and animals\n- 5 biomes featuring different predators, prey and flora to explore\n- Game mechanics inspired on population genetics\n\nEducational aspects:\nWhile playing Niche, the player is introduced to the scientific mechanics of genetics (featuring dominant-recessive, co-dominant inheritance, etc). The game also features the five pillars of population genetics (genetic drift, genetic flow, mutation, natural selection, sexual selection). All knowledge is interwoven with the game-mechanics. This creates the effect of learning by playing.\n\nGames/books that inspired us:\n- Spore\n- Don\u2019t Starve\n- The Creatures Series\n- Warrior Cats",
