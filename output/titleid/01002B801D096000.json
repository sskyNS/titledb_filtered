	"description": "Morkull Ragast's Rage is a 2D video game that combines platforming and action with a touch of exploration.\n\nYou control Morkull, the villain of the story, who not only knows he's a character in a video game, but is also aware of the player who controls him (i.e., you) and the developers who created him (i.e., us).\n\nYour objective? Help Morkull escape from the Ragast so he can rule the world and carry out his evil plans.\nYou know, typical clich\u00e9 villain stuff...\n\n\nArt and Animation\n\nMorkull Ragast's Rage is completely hand-drawn and animated frame-by-frame. Inspired and influenced by traditional animated films and other 2D video games, the old-school style gives life and fluidity of movement to the whole cast of characters.\n\nBreak the Fourth Wall\n\nWhat makes this game special is Morkull himself, his personality, and his ability to break the fourth wall to talk with the players like he was there in the room.\n\nMorkull possesses charisma and charm, and never fails to create a light-hearted atmosphere with his endless humor, bad jokes and pop culture references.\n\nCombat System\n\nYou'll have all the power of the God of Death and Darkness at your fingertips, of course, along with an ample selection of combos and abilities that will open up even the most remote corners of the Ragast.\n\nBecome Part of the Ragast and Join Our Community\n\nOnce you enter the Ragast, you'll never leave - unless you can get through Morkull\u2026 So why not join his ranks and support his Machiavellian cause with the rest of his champions as part of our Morkull Ragast's Rage community.",
