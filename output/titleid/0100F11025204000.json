	"intro": "An asymmetric, cooperative dungeon defense game where you play as monsters protecting their hard-earned treasures against invading \u201cheroes\u201d trying to steal it.",
	"description": "Monsters may die, which is tragic, but you can always bring them back to the dungeon! So you are never eliminated from the game, however, treasure gone, is gone forever.\n\nEach player chooses one of the monsters to play. All monsters have their own special abilities, a different amount of creatures and their unique starting deck of cards. The game supports local and online co-op!\n\nIn your turn, use your cards one at a time to perform actions. The order of the icons on a card is not mandatory, and you may split actions between multiple monsters you have in play. At the end of your turn, refill your hand back to five cards.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will be able to craft loot cards and improve your deck.\n\nPlayers take turns controlling their monsters on the dungeon. Each monster has a different role to play, some are crowd-control, others can be defensive or supporters, figuring out these combinations and solving an evolving puzzle together can be a lot of fun.\n\nAfter a player finishes their turn, heroes will invade our dungeon and attack us! Monsters may die, which is tragic, but you can always bring them back to the dungeon! So you are never eliminated from the game, however, a treasure stolen, is gone forever.\n\nIf at any point of the game we lose our vault's hoard, the game ends in defeat, but if we manage to protect our treasures for long enough, we all win.\n\nEach of the levels has a different dungeon layout along with special rules & cards to spice things up! From introductory scenarios where Olga the witch needs frogs to make potions, to more wild ones like the battle of the bands.",
