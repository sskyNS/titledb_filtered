	"description": "The gods of Olympus seek a mortal champion to fight against a rising darkness. Only those who endure their trials may be chosen.\nIn Trials of Olympus, you journey through the realms of Ares, Artemis, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. Each god\u2019s domain holds three great trials \u2014 vast platforming levels filled with traps, enemies, and divine essences to recover.\nYou cannot fight, for no weapon is yet yours. Instead, rely on agility and wit:\n\u2022\tDash forward, upward, or downward to escape danger.\n\u2022\tDouble jump and float across perilous gaps.\n\u2022\tDodge fearsome enemies you cannot yet strike.\n\u2022\tCollect ambrosia to restore your mana and keep moving.\n\u2022\tExplore expansive worlds inspired by each god\u2019s power.\nGather all divine essences and earn the gods\u2019 favor to ascend Olympus. Male or female hero \u2014 switch freely and face your destiny.\nWill you be the mortal chosen to stand with the gods?\n",
