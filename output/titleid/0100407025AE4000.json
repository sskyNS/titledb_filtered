	"description": "Lonely Guardian is a relaxing and accessible 2D platformer where you play as a Foo Dog, a mythical creature from East Asian culture. Your sacred mission is simple: collect the Mystic Pearl, rescue a lost pup, and reach the temple gate in each level.\n\nWith clear and intuitive gameplay, the game combines light exploration, precise jumps, and a purifying roar that defeats yokai, breaks stone blocks, and opens hidden paths. Everything is designed to be instantly understood, without tutorials or complicated menus.\n\nEach stage is a short and rewarding challenge, requiring attention, timing, and quick thinking to traverse fixed, moving, or collapsing platforms, avoid dangerous spikes, and activate spiritual altars as checkpoints.\n\nThe adventure features 30 levels divided into two unique biomes:\n\nSacred Temple Ruins (Levels 1\u201315): a serene setting of stone courtyards overgrown by nature, where players learn the core mechanics in a welcoming environment.\n\nForest of Echoes (Levels 16\u201330): a mysterious nocturnal realm lit by floating lanterns, where more aggressive yokai and new hazards raise the challenge.\n\nWith its spiritual atmosphere, clean visuals, and engaging progression, Lonely Guardian is the perfect experience for fans of casual, charming, and mystical platformers.",
