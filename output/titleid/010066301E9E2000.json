Ninja Chowdown: Glaze of Glory is a delicious pixel art arcade that will put your abilities to test.\n\nNinja Chowdown: Glaze of Glory is the ultimate challenge for fans of martial arts and food. Embark on an action challenge full of surprises. Play as Donatsu, the chubby ninja and use your secret arts to fight along 35 action packed levels, in which to collect donuts and defeat members of evil food clans such as the Travelling Rollnin, Pizza Pierates or Barbaricans.\n\nThe Dough-jo Donuttery, a food shop and a ninja dojo at the same time, is climbing to the top of the food chain... the top of the chain of the world's food chains! Like every other one in this world, run by cuisine champions and competing food clans. A strong flavor breeds an equally strong fighting spirit!\n\nThe adventure begins when The Traveling Rollnin's leader, Sushi Sam, steals the Know-nut, the Doughnut of Ultimate Knowledge, from the Dough-jo. And no one but Donatsu is skilled and badass enough to get it back!\n\nNinja Chowdown: Glaze of Glory is a colorful pixel art arcade, easy to learn but difficult to master, even for a shinobi. A 2D runner that will put your ninja abilities to test, with short fast-paced levels designed for replayability in three game modes. \n\nUse your weapons to take your enemies down, evade dangerous traps and face the clan leaders. Upon collecting enough donuts, you will enter your Doughjutsu Mode, a temporary, invincible mode that transforms you into a big projectile.\n\nUnlock new crazy costumes, choose your favorite ninja pets -from shinobi cats to alien ships- and wield lethal and delicious weapons, ranging from shuriken to bananas, to customize your adventure.",
