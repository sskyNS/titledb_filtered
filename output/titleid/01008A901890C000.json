But as victory is just within the party\u2019s grasp, a tragedy occurs, the clock resets, and they have to do it all again.\n\nAs Siffrin\u2019s the only one who notices this loop, each new start wears away at his cheerful veneer, yet he keeps going in hopes he can end this temporal tragedy once and for all.\n\nIn Stars and Time is a time-looping RPG adventure. With each loop, Siffrin gains a new perspective on the world around them, opening up new solutions to puzzles and allowing them to make better choices in conversation.

(Don\u2019t worry about it. They\u2019re doing fine.) The punmaster protagonist of our neverending tale.\n- Mirabelle (she/her): A caring and nervous housemaiden mysteriously blessed by the god she so ardently follows.\n- Isabeau (he/him): Defender with a heart of gold. Cares dearly for his people and his friends.\n- Odile (she/her): The mature and nonsensical researcher studying\u2026something. (No, she will not tell you what it is.)\n- Bonnie (they/them): Wait a minute, who brought this kid along???\n\n\n\u2726Features\n- Save the world through the power of Rock, Paper, Scissors in strategic turn-based RPG combat encounters.\n- Ignore the limits of time and space to fix your past mistakes by repeating the same two days over and over again.\n- Equip the memories you have of your friends to make your party stronger in combat. \n- Watch the fate of this world unfold as you escape the twists and turns of this endless(???) loop.\n- Eat samossas with your friends!\n- Get heckled by a cheeky ethereal being of infinite starlight.\n- Pray to a god for good luck in your travels. You\u2019re gonna need it.\n\n---\n\nIn Stars and Time occasionally explores topics that some players might find upsetting, such as death, mental illness, and violence.\nYou can learn more about these and other content warnings on the official In Stars and Time website.\nPlease play with care!",
