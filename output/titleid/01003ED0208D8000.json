	"description": "Use forensic science to investigate \"unsolvable cases\"\n\nA new viral outbreak has forced Tokyo to go into an extended lockdown. Finally coming out of the bleak, three year epidemic it seems life has finally returned to normal... until a string of paranormal incidents begin to occur. It's up to you and your colleagues to solve these cases once and for all!\n\n\nRealistic forensic tools\n\nUse the resources at your disposal such as images and surveillance footage to perform a careful analysis and determine items, persons, and other points of interest. Be sure to review security camera footage thoroughly, as it can allow you to gather specific details of victims' behavior at the moment of the incident, and even review what happened before or after.\n\n\nOrganize your evidence board\n\nDetermine answers by collecting and organizing evidence on the evidence board. Proper use will allow you clearly to see how items in your case interrelate. The outcome of each case will be determined by the degree to which you were able to resolve the case. Can you solve all of the difficult cases that lie ahead?",
