	"description": "\"NAVARONE\" is a shooting game developed by NAMCO (Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc) that was in operation at arcades around 1980.\nTake control of a fighter plane on a mission to destroy enemy targets of various sizes scattered across a peninsula.\nWhen you take down a major target, all of the minor targets around it will be destroyed with it. You get a bigger bonus from taking out the targets with fewer shots, so aim carefully!\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.\n\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
