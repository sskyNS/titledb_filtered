	"description": "Follow the rainbow, find the gold! In Cloud to Gold, every puzzle is a magical mix of logic and charm. You play as a mischievous leprechaun on a quest to push clouds, fill holes, and create rainbow paths that lead straight to the legendary pot of gold. The rules are simple but the challenge is clever. Push clouds in straight lines, watch them slide until they hit an obstacle, and see them fall perfectly into place. Break objects to clear the way, redirect clouds with arrows, and master tiles that change the flow of your journey. Every move counts as you shape the path toward treasure. Across dozens of handcrafted maps, puzzles grow bigger and more intricate, constantly introducing new tricks and mechanics. What begins as a playful stroll soon becomes a satisfying brain-teasing adventure, where rainbows are your bridges and gold is your reward. Whether you\u2019re here for a relaxing puzzle session or to conquer every clever challenge, Cloud to Gold delivers a charming, colorful journey full of wit, rainbows, and shiny treasures.",
