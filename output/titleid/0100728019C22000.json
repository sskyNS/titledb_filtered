	"description": "In a nutshell:\n - A micro RPG with about 2-4 hours of play for each run\n - Randomized worlds, dungeons, and cities\n - A cool personality profile at the end of each game based on your actions during play\n - 6 Kitty classes to choose from! Some are easier to use, some make the game so much harder. Experiment and find out which works best for you. You might be surprised!\n\nThe purrfect 8bit RPG with Kittens - There is a Big Bad Evil (tm) that has come to destroy kitten land. A cosmic horror from beyond the litter box wastes. And only one brave hero hears the call, to come forth and put an end to all the suffering across the meowtiverse.  Choose your class, name your kitty, and set off on an adventure!\n\nBe warned, you only have nine lives to live. If they run out, so does your game, and you'll have to start over again with a new kitten, in a new randomly generated world, with a whole new quest to complete.",
