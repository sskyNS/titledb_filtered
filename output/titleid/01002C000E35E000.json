	"description": "WHAT'S NEW?\n\nFree new content! In our slimiest update yet, chaos has stroke and the golf lab is in disarray. It's dangerous out there, things have come alive and there's green goo everywhere... \nWill you make it through to the end?\n\nLook out for exciting monthly events!\n\nA silly physics-based golf parody where every golf course is a new surprising type of golf, some brilliant or hilarious, others so absurd you will ask yourself: WHAT THE GOLF?\n\nNOT A GOLF GAME!\nSure, it has \u2018golf\u2019 in the title but that\u2019s about where the similarity to golf ends. WHAT THE GOLF? is at heart a comedy game with puzzles, challenges and loads of surprises. Okay, so there\u2019s a bit of what you might recognise as golf in there but loads more of what definitely isn\u2019t! Confused? Excellent!\n\n500 CREATIVE LEVELS\nTry Sporty Sports!, It\u2019s Snowtime, Among Golf or one of the hundreds of other incomprehensible levels, featuring toasters, hot dogs, office chairs and a multitude of utterly random objects.\n\nDAILY CHALLENGES\nCome back every day to play new courses and win a bunch of more or less useful prizes.\n\nJOIN THE COUCH PARTY\u2026 OF TWO\nGrab your clubs (string of sausages, frozen rubber glove, it doesn\u2019t matter which) and tee off into a hilarious anarchic world. \n\nBUT I HATE GOLF\nTo be honest, so do we. And that\u2019s the beauty of WHAT THE GOLF? A game made for people who hate golf, by people with no clues or respect for the game. Let\u2019s play!",
