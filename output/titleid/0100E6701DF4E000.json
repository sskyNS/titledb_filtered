Faced with this evil, the Ravenswatch is gathering heroes from tales and legends from all over the world to lead a crucial battle and restore the fragile balance.\nBut the heroes themselves have been corrupted. How deep do the roots of this evil go?\n* Explore 3 open maps filled with activities and inspired by enchanted forests and marshes, One Thousand and One Nights, and Arthurian legends respectively.\n* Help the inhabitants of Reverie, such as the Three Little Pigs, Sinbad the Sailor and Morgan the fairy, and earn valuable rewards to help you in your future battles.\n* Reveal the story of each character and Reverie, run after run.\n* Ravenswatch is a meticulously crafted combination of a dark fantasy atmosphere with a comic book style.\n\nNERVE-RACKING GAMEPLAY, SOLO OR CO-OP\nTo defeat the Nightmare and reach the final chapter, you will need a strong build, focus and/or excellent teamwork.
