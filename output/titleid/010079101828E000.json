	"description": "Super Perils of Baking is a ground-up remake of Lillymo Games\u2019 very first title, 2018\u2019s 2D platformer Perils of Baking. In Super Perils of Baking, players take control of a talented student-baker who has but one goal in mind: Stopping his brother -- enchanted by a cursed baking hat garnered from their school's basement -- from wreaking havoc throughout the land.\n\nWritten entirely in verse with a storybook-like presentation, Super Perils of Baking spans 50 core levels and totes plenty of secrets, too. With concise 2D platforming, balanced difficulty, beautiful pixel art, a fun soundtrack, and tons to unlock (including new playable characters). Lillymo\u2019s newest offering is made for audiences young and old (and is especially cute for adults to play with their children).\n\nWhether on foot, hurtling in a minecart, swimming underwater, holding onto a balloon, or altering gravity and quite literally turning things upside down, Super Perils of Baking is a food fight for everyone... and True Bakers will find tons of collectibles to keep them busy post\\-adventure, too.",
