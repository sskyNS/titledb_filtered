	"description": "This is an alchemy academy RPG set at the Cagliostro Academy of Magic in the world of the continent of Arcaus, which is threatened by a crisis known as the Oblivion. The story follows the protagonist, Shin, his older apprentice sister Aria, the princess and aspiring alchemist Ceres, and his familiar Enri, who seeks the meaning of its existence. Together, they experience various trials and strengthen their bond as they face the threat of this world-ending disaster.\nThe game is divided into two parts: an \"Adventure Part,\" where players deepen their relationships and create bonds with their companions, and an \"RPG Dungeon Part,\" where players progress in their journey by strengthening their party using equipment gained through alchemy and materials gathered, as well as forging contracts with divine beings known as \"Creators,\" who act as guardians of the world. Additionally, players can collect the crystals of these creators, called \"Crests,\" and craft equipment. The game also features various difficulty levels and a loop function, offering a strong focus on replayability.",
